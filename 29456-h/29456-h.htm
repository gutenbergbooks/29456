<h4>TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h4>

<hr class = "micro">

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> Author of this little work
cannot allow a second edition of it to go forth to the world,
unaccompanied by a few words of apology, he being desirous of imitating,
in every respect, the example of distinguished writers.</p>

<p>He begs that so much as the consciousness of being answerable for a
great deal of nonsense, usually prompts a man to say, in the hope of
disarming criticism, may be considered to have been said already. But he
particularly requests that the want of additions to his book may be
excused; and
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
pleads, in arrest of judgment, his numerous and absorbing
avocations.</p>

<p>Wishing to atone as much as possible for this deficiency, and
prevailed upon by the importunity of his friends, he has allowed a
portrait of himself, by that eminent artist, Mr. John Leech, to whom he
is indebted for the embellishments, and very probably for the sale of
the book, to be presented, facing the title-page, to the public.</p>

<p>Here again he has been influenced by the wish to comply with the
requisitions of custom, and the disinclination to appear odd, whimsical,
or peculiar.</p>

<p>On the admirable sketch itself, bare justice requires that he should
speak somewhat in detail. The likeness he is told, he fears by too
partial admirers, is excellent. The principle on which it has been
executed, that of investing with an ideal magnitude, the proportions of
nature, is plainly, from what we observe in heroic poetry, painting, and
sculpture, the soul itself of the superhuman
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
and sublime. Of the justness of the metaphorical compliment implied in
the delineation of the head, it is not for the author to speak; of its
exquisiteness and delicacy, his sense is too strong for expression. The
habitual pensiveness of the elevated eyebrows, mingled with the
momentary gaiety of the rest of the countenance, is one of the most
successful points in the picture, and is as true to nature as it is
indicative of art.</p>

<p>The Author’s tailor, though there are certain reasons why his name
should not appear in print, desires to express his obligation to the
talented artist for the very favourable impression which, without
prejudice to truth, has been given to the public of his skill. The ease
so conspicuous in the management of the surtout, and the thought so
remarkable in the treatment of the trousers, fully warrant his
admiration and gratitude.</p>

<p>Too great praise cannot be bestowed on the boots, considered with
reference to art, though in this respect the Author is quite sensible
that both himself
<span class = "pagenum">||</span>
and the maker of their originals have been greatly flattered. He is also
perfectly aware that there is a degree of neatness, elegance, and spirit
in the tie of the cravat, to which he has in reality never yet been able
to attain.</p>

<p>In conclusion, he is much gratified by the taste displayed in
furnishing him with so handsome a walking stick; and he assures all whom
it may concern, that the hint thus bestowed will not be lost upon him;
for he intends immediately to relinquish the large oaken cudgel which he
has hitherto been accustomed to carry, and to appear, in every respect,
to the present generation, such as he will descend to posterity.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<hr class = "micro">

<p><span class = "firstword">A great</span> book, says an old proverb,
is a great evil; and a great preface, says a new one, is a great bore.
It is not, therefore, our intention to expatiate largely on the present
occasion; especially since a long discourse prefixed to a small volume,
is like a forty-eight pounder at the door of a pig-stye. We should as
soon think of erecting the Nelson Memorial in front of Buckingham
Palace. Indeed, were it not necessary to show some kind of respect to
fashion, we should hasten at once into the midst of things, instead of
trespassing on the patience of our readers, and possibly, trifling with
their time. We should not like to be kept waiting at a Lord Mayor’s
feast by a long description of the bill of fare. Our preface, however,
shall at least have the merit of novelty; <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘is’">it</ins> shall be candid.</p>

<p>This book, like the razors in Dr. Wolcot’s story, is made to
<i>sell</i>. This last word has a rather equivocal meaning&mdash;but we
scorn to blot, otherwise we should say to be sold. An article offered
for sale may, nevertheless, be worth buying; and it is hoped that the
resemblance between the aforesaid
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
razors, and this our production, does not extend to the respective
<i>sharpness</i> of the commodities. The razors proved scarcely worth a
farthing to the clown who bought them for eighteen-pence, and were fit
to shave nothing but the beard of an oyster. We trust that the “Comic
Latin Grammar” will be found to <i>cut</i>, now and then, rather better,
at least, than that comes to; and that it will reward the purchaser, at
any rate, with his pennyworth for his penny, by its genuine bonâ fide
contents. There are many works, the pages of which contain a good deal
of useful matter&mdash;sometimes in the shape of an ounce of tea or a
pound of butter: we venture to indulge the expectation, that these
latter additions to the value of our own, will be considered
unnecessary.</p>

<p>Perhaps we should have adopted the title of “Latin in sport made
learning in earnest”&mdash;which would give a tolerable idea of the
nature of our undertaking. The doctrine, it is true, may bear the same
relation to the lighter matter, that the bread in Falstaff’s private
account did to the liquor; though if we have given our reader
“a&nbsp;deal of sack,” we wish it may not be altogether “intolerable.”
Latin, however, is a great deal less like bread, to most boys, than it
is like physic; especially <i>antimony</i>, <i>ipecacuanha</i>, and
similar medicines. It ought, therefore, to be given in something
palatable,
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
and capable of causing it to be retained by the&mdash;mind&mdash;in what
physicians call a pleasant vehicle. This we have endeavoured to
invent&mdash;and if we have disguised the flavour of the drugs without
destroying their virtues, we shall have entirely accomplished our
design. There are a few particularly nasty pills, draughts, and boluses,
which we could find no means of sweetening; and with which, on that
account, we have not attempted to meddle. For these omissions we must
request some little indulgence. Our performance is confessedly
imperfect, but be it remembered, that</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Men rather do their broken weapons use,</p>
<p>Than their bare hands.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “Comic Latin Grammar” can, certainly, never be called an
<i>imposition</i>, as another Latin Grammar frequently is. We remember
having had the whole of it to learn at school, besides being&mdash;no
matter what&mdash;for pinning a cracker to the master’s coat-tail. The
above hint is worthy the attention of boys; nor will the following,
probably, be thrown away upon school-masters, particularly such as
reside in the north of England. “Laugh and grow fat,” is an ancient and
a true maxim. Now, will not the “Comic Latin Grammar,” (like Scotch
marmalade and Yarmouth bloaters) form a “desirable addition” to the
breakfast of the young
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
gentlemen entrusted to their care? We dare not say much of its
superseding the use of the cane, as we hold all old established customs
in the utmost reverence and respect; and, besides, have no wish to
deprive any one of innocent amusement. We would only suggest, that
flagellation is now <i>sometimes</i> necessary, and that whatever tends
to render it <i>optional</i> may, now and then, save trouble.</p>

<p>One word in conclusion. The march of intellect is not confined to the
male sex; the fairer part of the creation are now augmenting by their
numbers, and adorning by their countenance, the scientific and literary
train. But the path of learning is sometimes too rugged for their tender
feet. We pretend not to strew it for them with roses; we are not
poetically given&mdash;nay, we cannot even promise them a Brussels
carpet;&mdash;but if a plain Kidderminster will serve their turn, we
here display one for their accommodation, that thus smoothly and
pleasantly they may make their safe ascent to the temple of Minerva and
the Muses.</p>




<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<hr class = "micro">

<p><span class = "firstword">Very</span> little introductory matter
would probably be sufficient to place the rising generation on terms of
the most perfect familiarity with a “Comic Latin Grammar.” To the elder
and middle-aged portion of the community, however, the very notion of
such a work may seem in the highest degree preposterous; if not
indicative of a degree of presumptuous irreverence on the part of the
author little short of literary high treason, if not commensurate, in
point of moral delinquency, with the same crime as defined by the common
law of England. It is out of consideration for the praiseworthy, though
perhaps erroneous, feelings of such respectable personages, that we
proceed to make the following preliminary remarks; wherein it will be
our object, by demonstrating the necessity which exists for such a
publication as the present, to exonerate ourselves from all blame on the
score of its production.</p>

<p>When we consider the progress of civilization and refinement, we find
that all ages have in turn
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
been characterized by some one distinctive peculiarity or other. To say
nothing of the Golden Age, the Silver Age, the Iron Age, and so forth,
which, with all possible respect for the poets, can scarcely be said to
be worth much in a grave argument; it is quite clear that the Augustan
Age, the Middle Ages, the Elizabethan Age, and the Age of Queen Anne,
were all of them very different, one from the other, in regard to the
peculiar tone of feeling which distinguished the public mind in each of
them. In like manner, the present (which will hereafter probably be
called the Victorian Age) is very unlike all that have preceded it. It
may be termed the Age of Comicality. Not but that some traces of comic
feeling, inherent as it is in the very nature of man, have not at all
times been more or less observable; but it is only of late years that
the ludicrous capabilities of the human mind have expanded in their
fullest vigour. Comicality has heretofore been evinced only, as it were,
in isolated sparks and flashes, instead of that full blaze of meridian
splendour which now pervades the entire mechanism of society, and
illuminates all the transactions of life. Thus in the Golden Age, there
was something very comical in human creatures eating acorns, like pigs.
The Augustan Age was comical enough, if we may trust some of Horace’s
satires. Much comicality was displayed
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
in the Middle Ages, in the proceedings of the knights errant, the doings
in Palestine, and the mode adopted by the priests of inculcating
religion on the minds of the people. In the Elizabethan Age several
comic incidents occurred at court; particularly when any of the
courtiers were guilty of personal impertinence to their virgin queen. It
must have been very comical to see Shakspere holding stirrups like an
ostler, or performing the part of the Ghost, in his own play of Hamlet.
The dress worn in Queen Anne’s time, and that of the first Georges, was
very comical indeed&mdash;but enough of this. Our concern is with the
present time&mdash;the funniest epoch, beyond all comparison, in the
history of the world. Some few years back, the minds of nations,
convulsed with the great political revolutions then taking place, were
in a mood by no means apt to be gratified by whimsicality and merriment.
Furthermore, certain poets of the lack-a-daisical school, such as Byron,
Shelley, Goethe, and others, writing in <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘comformity’">conformity</ins> with the prevailing taste
of the day, threw a wet blanket on the spirits of men, which all but
extinguished the feeble embers of mirth, upon which ‘shocking events’
had exercised so pernicious an influence already: or, to change a vulgar
for a scientific metaphor, they placed such a pressure of sentimental
atmosphere on the common stock of laughing gas, as to
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
convert it into a mere fluid, and almost to solidify it altogether. It
is now exhibiting the amazing amount of expansive force, which under
favourable circumstances it is capable of exerting. Many causes have
combined to bring about the happy state of things under which we now
live. Amongst these, the exertions of individuals hold the first rank;
of whom the veteran Liston, the late lamented Mr. John Reeve, the
facetious Keeley, and the inimitable Buckstone, are deserving of our
highest commendation. And more <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘epecially’">especially</ins> is praise due to the talented author
of the Pickwick Papers, whose genius has convulsed the sides of
thousands, has revolutionized the republic of letters (making, no doubt,
a&nbsp;great many <i>sovereigns</i>) and has become, as it were,
a&nbsp;mirror, which will reflect to all posterity the laughter-loving
spirit of his age<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ,">.&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>But it is not (as we have before remarked) in literature alone, that
the tendency to the ludicrous is shewn. In many recent scientific
speculations it is strikingly and abundantly obvious&mdash;some of those
on geology may be quoted as examples. The offspring of the
sciences&mdash;those pledges of affection which they present to art,
almost all of them, come into the world with a caricature-like smirk
upon their faces. Air-balloons and rail-roads have something funny about
them; and photogenic drawings are, to say the least, very curious. The
learned
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
professions are all tinged with drollery. The law is confessedly
ridiculous from beginning to end, and what is very strange, is that no
one should attempt to make it otherwise. Medicine is comical&mdash;or
rather tragi-comical&mdash;the disparity of opinion among its
professors, the chaotic state of its principles, and the conduct of its
students being considered. No one can deny that the distribution of
church property is somewhat <i>odd</i>, or can assert that the
doings&mdash;at least of those who are destined for the clerical office,
are now and then of rather a strange character. Political meetings are
very laughable things, when we reflect upon the strong asseverations of
patriotism there made and believed. The wisdom of the legislature is by
no means of the gravest class, particularly when it offers municipal
reforms as a substitute for bread. The debates in a certain House must
be of a very humourous character, if we may judge from the frequent
“hear hear, and a laugh,” by which the proceedings there are
interrupted. Our risible faculties are continually called into action at
public lectures of all kinds; and indeed, no lecturer, however learned
he may be, has much chance now-a-days of instructing, unless he can also
amuse his audience. Nor can the various public and even private
buildings, which are daily springing up around us, like so many
mushrooms, be contemplated
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
without considerable emotions of mirthfulness. The new style of
ecclesiastical architecture, entitled the Cockney-Gothic, affords a good
illustration of this remark; but the comic Temple of the Fine Arts, in
Trafalgar Square, is what Lord Bacon would have called a “glaring
instance” of its correctness. The occurrences of the day bear all of
them the stamp of facetiousness. The vote of approbation, lately passed
on a certain course of policy, is a capital joke; the tricks that are
constantly played off upon John Bull by the Russians, French, Yankees,
and others, though somewhat impertinent to the aforesaid John, must seem
very diverting to lookers on. The state of the Drama may also be brought
forward in proof of our position. Tragedies are at a discount; farces
are at a premium; lions, nay goats and monkeys, are pressed into the
service of Momus. Even the various institutions for the advancement of
morals have not escaped the influence of the prevailing taste. To
mention that respectable body of men, the Teetotallers, is sufficient of
itself to excite a smile. In short, look wherever you will, you will
find it a matter of the greatest difficulty to keep your
countenance.</p>

<p>The truth is, that people are tired of crying, and find it much more
agreeable to laugh. The sublime is out of fashion; the ridiculous is in
vogue.
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
A&nbsp;turn-up nose is now a more interesting object than a turn-down
collar; and if it should be urged that the flowing locks of our young
men are indicative of sentimentality by their <i>length</i>, let it be
remembered that they are in general quite unaccompanied by a
corresponding quality of face. It has been said that the schoolmaster is
abroad:&mdash;true; but he is walking arm and arm with the Merry-Andrew;
and the members, presidents, and secretaries of mechanics’ institutions,

Nothing can be taught that is not palatable, and nothing is now
palatable but what is funny. That boys should be instructed in the Latin
language will be denied by few (although by some eccentric persons this
has been done); that they can be expected to learn what they cannot
laugh at will, to all reflecting minds, especially on perusing the
foregoing considerations, appear in the highest degree unreasonable. To
conclude:&mdash;let all such as are disposed to stare at the title of
our work, ponder attentively on what we have said above; let them, in
the language of the farce, “put this and that together,” and they will
at once perceive the beneficial effect, which holding up the Latin
Grammar to ridicule is likely to produce in the minds of youth. So much
for the satisfaction of our senior readers. And now, no longer to detain

Proper, or good Latin, is the language which was spoken by the ancient
Romans. Dog Latin is the Latin in which boys compose their first verses
and themes, and which is occasionally employed at the Universities of
Oxford and Cambridge, but much more frequently at Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
and Glasgow. It includes Medical Latin, and Law Latin; though these, to
the unlearned, generally appear Greek. Mens tuus ego&mdash;mind your
eye; Illic vadis cum oculo tuo ex&mdash;there you go with your eye out;
Quomodo est mater tua?&mdash;how’s your mother? Fiat haustus ter die

<p>Thieves’ Latin, more commonly known by the name of slang, is much in
use among a certain class of <i>conveyancers</i>, who disregard the
distinctions of meum and tuum. Furthermore, it constitutes a great part
of the familiar discourse of most young men in modern times,
particularly lawyers’ clerks and medical students. It bears a very close
affinity to Law Latin, with which, indeed, it is sometimes confounded.
Examples:&mdash;to prig a wipe&mdash;to steal a handkerchief. A&nbsp;rum

<p>If Toby, the learned pig, had been desired to say his alphabet in
Latin, he would have done it by taking away the W from the English
alphabet. Indeed, this is what he is said to have actually done. The
Latin letters, therefore, remind us of the greatest age that a
fashionable lady ever confesses she has attained to,&mdash;being between
twenty and thirty.</p>

<p>Six of these letters are called what Dutchmen, speaking English, call
fowls&mdash;vowels; namely, a, e, i, o, u, y.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<p>A vowel is like an Æolian harp; it makes a full and perfect sound of
itself. A&nbsp;consonant cannot sound without a vowel, any more than a
horn (except such an one as Baron Munchausen’s) can play a tune without
a performer.</p>

<p>Consonants are divided into mutes, liquids and double letters;
although they have nothing in particular to do with funerals,
hydrostatics, or the General post office. The liquids are, l, m, n, r;
the double letters, j, x, z; the other letters are mutes.</p>

<p>A diphthong is the sound of two vowels in one syllable. Taken
collectively they resemble a closed fist&mdash;i.e. a&nbsp;bunch of
<i>fives</i>. The diphthongs are au, eu, ei, æ, and œ. Of the two first
of these, au and eu, the sound is <i>intermediate</i> between that of
the two vowels of which each is formed. This fact may perhaps be
impressed upon the mind, on the principles of artificial memory, by a
reference to a familiar beverage, known by the name of half-and-half. In
like manner, ei, which is generally pronounced i, and æ and œ, sounded
like e,
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
may be said to exhibit something like an analogy to a married couple.
The human diphthong, Smith female + Brown male, is called Brown
only.</p>

<h4>OF A NOUN.</h4>

<p>A noun is a name,&mdash;whether it be a Christian name, or a

Whatever is&mdash;is a noun.</p>

<p>Nouns are divided into substantives and adjectives.</p>

<p>A noun substantive is its own trumpeter, and speaks for itself
without assistance from any other word&mdash;brassica, a&nbsp;cabbage;
sartor, a&nbsp;tailor; medicus, a physician; vetula, an old woman;
venenum, <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘posion’">poison</ins>; are examples of substantives.</p>

<p>An adjective is like an infant in leading strings&mdash;it cannot go
alone. It always requires to be joined to a substantive, of which it
shows the nature or quality&mdash;as lectio longa, a&nbsp;long lesson;
magnus aper, a&nbsp;great <i>boar</i>; pinguis puer, a&nbsp;fat boy;
macer puer, a&nbsp;lean boy. In making love (as you will find
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
one of these days) or in abusing a cab-man, your success will depend in
no small degree in your choice of adjectives.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<h4>NUMBERS OF NOUNS.</h4>

<p>Be not alarmed, boys, at the above heading. There are numbers of
nouns, it is true, that is to say, lots; or, as we say in the schools,
“a&nbsp;precious sight” of nouns in the dictionary; but we are not now
going to enumerate, and make you learn them. The numbers of nouns here
spoken of are two only; the singular and the plural.</p>

<p>The singular speaks but of one&mdash;as later, a&nbsp;brick; faba,
a&nbsp;bean; tuba, a&nbsp;trump (or trumpet); flamma, a&nbsp;blaze;
æthiops, a&nbsp;nigger (or negro); cornix, a crow.</p>

<p>The plural speaks of more than one&mdash;as lateres, bricks; fabæ,
beans; tubæ, trumps; flammæ, blazes; æthiopes, niggers; cornices,
crows.</p>

<p>Here it may be remarked that the cynic philosophers were very
<i>singular</i> fellows.</p>

<p>Also that prize-poems are sometimes composed in very <i>singular
numbers</i>.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<h4>CASES OF NOUNS.</h4>

<p>Nouns have six cases in each number, (that is, six of one and half a
dozen of the other) but can only be put in one of them at a time. They
are thus ticketed&mdash;nominative, genitive, dative, accusative,
vocative, and ablative.</p>

<p>The nominative case comes before the verb, as the horse does before
the cart, the “lieutenant before the ancient,” and the superintendant of
police before the inspector. It answers to the question, who or what;
as, Who jaws? magister jurgatur, the master jaws.</p>

<p>The genitive case is known by the sign of, and answers to the
question, whose, or whereof; as<ins class = "correction" title = ", missing">, </ins>Whose breeches? Femoralia magistri&mdash;the breeches
of the master, or the master’s breeches.</p>

<p>The dative case is known by the signs to or for, and answers to the
question, to whom, or to or for what; as, To whom do I hold out my
hands? Protendo manus magistro&mdash;I&nbsp;hold out my hands to the
master.</p>

<p>In this place we are called upon to consider, whether it be more
agreeable to have Latin or the ferula at our <i>fingers’ ends</i>.</p>

<p>Observe that <i>dative</i> means <i>giving</i>. Schoolmasters are
very often in the dative case&mdash;but
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
their generosity is chiefly exercised in bestowing what is termed
monkey’s allowance; that is, if not more kicks, more boxes on the ear,
more spats, more canings, birchings, and impositions, than
halfpence.</p>

alt = "schoolmaster spatting a boy"></p>

<p class = "caption">
A DATIVE AND A VOCATIVE CASE.</p>
</div>

<p>The accusative case follows the verb, as a bailiff follows a debtor,
a&nbsp;bull-dog a butcher, or a round of applause a supernatural squall
at the Italian Opera. It answers to the question Whom? or What? as, Whom
do you laugh at? (behind his back) Derideo magistrum&mdash;I&nbsp;laugh
at the master.</p>

<p>The vocative case is known by calling, or speaking to; as,
O&nbsp;magister&mdash;O&nbsp;master; an exclamation which is frequently
the consequence of shirking out, making false concords or quantities,
obstreperous conduct in school,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>The ablative case is known by certain prepositions, expressed or
understood; as Deprensus magistro&mdash;caught out by the master. Coram
<i>rostro</i>&mdash;before the <i>beak</i>. The prepositions, in, with,
from, by, and the word, than, after the comparative degree, are signs of
the ablative case. In angustiâ&mdash;in a fix. Cum indigenâ&mdash;with a
native. Ab arbore&mdash;from a tree. A&nbsp;rictu&mdash;by a grin. Adipe
lubricior&mdash;slicker than grease.</p>

<h4>GENDERS AND ARTICLES.</h4>

<p>The genders of nouns, which are three, the masculine, the feminine,
and the neuter, are denoted in Latin by articles. We have articles,
also, in English, which distinguish the masculine from the feminine, but
they are articles of dress; such as petticoats and breeches, mantillas
and mackintoshes. But as there are many things in Latin, called
masculine and feminine, which are nevertheless not
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
male and female, the articles attached to them are not parts of dress,
but parts of speech.</p>

<p>We will now, with our readers’ permission, initiate them into a new
mode of declining the article hic, hæc, hoc. And we take this
opportunity of protesting against the old and short-sighted system of
teaching a boy only one thing at a time, which originated, no doubt,
from the general ignorance of everything but the dead languages which
prevailed in the monkish ages. We propose to make declensions,
conjugations, &amp;c., a&nbsp;vehicle for imparting something more than
the mere dry facts of the immediate subject. And if we can occasionally
inculcate an original remark, a&nbsp;scientific principle, or a moral
aphorism, we shall, of course, think ourselves sufficiently rewarded by
the consciousness&mdash;et cætera, et cætera, et cætera.</p>

<p>And his, like the dative the ablative case is,</p>

</div>

<p>Nouns declined with two articles, are called common. This word common
requires explanation&mdash;it is not used in the same sense as that in
which we say, that quackery is common in medicine, knavery in the law,
and humbug everywhere&mdash;pigeons at Crockford’s, lame ducks at the
Stock Exchange, Jews at the ditto, and Royal ditto, and foreigners in
Leicester Square&mdash;No; a&nbsp;common noun is one that is both
masculine and feminine; in one sense of the word therefore it is
<i>uncommon</i>. Parens, a&nbsp;parent, which may be declined both with
hic, and hæc, is, for obvious reasons, a&nbsp;noun of this class; and so
is fur, a&nbsp;thief; likewise miles, a&nbsp;soldier, which will appear
strange to those of our readers, who do not call to mind the existence
of the ancient amazons; the dashing white sergeant
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
being the only female soldier known in modern times. Nor have we more
than one authenticated instance of a female sailor, if we except the
heroine commemorated in the somewhat apocryphal narrative&mdash;Billy
Taylor.</p>

<p>Nouns are called doubtful when declined with the article hic or
hæc&mdash;whichever you please, as the showman said of the Duke of
Wellington and Napoleon Bonaparte. Anguis, a&nbsp;snake, is a doubtful
noun. At all events he is a doubtful customer.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic27.png" width = "356" height = "317"
alt = "man with very large snake"></p>

<p>Epicene nouns are those which, though declined with one article only,
represent both sexes, as hic passer, a&nbsp;sparrow, hæc aquila, an
eagle,&mdash;cock and
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
hen. A&nbsp;sparrow, however, to say nothing of an eagle, must appear a
doubtful noun with regard to gender, to a cockney sportsman.</p>

<p>After all, there is no rule in the Latin language about gender so
comprehensive as that observed in Hampshire, where they call every thing
<i>he</i> but a tom-cat, and that <i>she</i>.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<h4>DECLENSION OF NOUNS SUBSTANTIVE.</h4>

<p>There are five declensions of substantives. As a pig is known by his
tail, so are declensions of substantives distinguished by the ending of
the genitive case. Our fear of outraging the comic feelings of humanity,
prevents us from saying quite so much about them as our love of learning
would otherwise induce us to do. We therefore refer the student to that
clever little book, the Eton Latin Grammar, strongly recommending him to
decline the following substantives, by way of an exercise, after the
manner of the examples there set down. First declension, Genitivo æ.
Virga, a rod. &mdash;Second, i. Puer, a&nbsp;boy. Stultus, a&nbsp;fool.
Tergum, a&nbsp;back. &mdash;Third, is<ins class = "correction" title =
"text has ,">. </ins>Vulpes, a&nbsp;fox. Procurator, an attorney.
Cliens, a&nbsp;client. &mdash;Fourth, ûs&mdash;here you may have, Risus,
a&nbsp;laugh at. &mdash;Fifth, ei. Effigies, an effigy, image, or
Guy.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<p>The substantive face, facies, <i>makes faces</i>, facies, in the
plural.</p>

<p>Although we are precluded from going through the whole of the
declensions, we cannot refrain from proposing “for the use of schools,”
a&nbsp;model upon which all substantives may be declined in a mode
somewhat more agreeable, if not more instructive, than that heretofore
adopted.</p>

<h4>COMPARISONS OF ADJECTIVES.</h4>

<p>Comparisons are odious&mdash;</p>

<p>Adjectives have three degrees of comparison. This is perhaps the
reason why they are so disagreeable to learn.</p>

<p>The first degree of comparison is the positive, which denotes the
quality of a thing absolutely. Thus, the Eton Latin Grammar is lepidus,
funny.</p>

<p>The second is the comparative, which increases or lessens the
quality, formed by adding <i>or</i> to the first case of the positive
ending in <i>i</i>. Thus the Charter House Grammar, is
lepidor&mdash;funnier, or more funny. &mdash;The third is the
superlative, which increases or diminishes the signification to the
greatest degree,
<span class = "pagenum">34</span>
formed from the same case by adding thereto, <i>ssimus</i>. Thus the
Comic Latin Grammar is <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘lipidissimus’">lepidissimus</ins>, funniest, or most funny.

<h4>DECLENSION OF PRONOUNS.</h4>

<p>Pronouns concern <i>ourselves</i> so much, that we cannot altogether
pass over them; though a hint or two with regard to the mode of learning
their declension is all that we can here afford to give. We are
constrained now and then to leave out a good deal of valuable matter,
for the reason that induced the Dublin manager to omit the part of
Hamlet in the play of that name&mdash;the length of the performance.</p>

<p>Pronouns may be thus agreeably declined:</p>

<div class = "verse">

<h4>OF A VERB.</h4>

<p>A verb is the chief word in every <i>sentence</i>, as
<i>Suspendatur</i> per collum, let him be hanged by the neck.</p>

<p>It expresses the action or being of a thing. Ego <i>sum</i> sapiens,
I&nbsp;am a wise man. Tu <i>es</i> stultus, thou art a fool. Non hic
amice, <i>pernoctas</i>, you don’t lodge here, Mr. Ferguson.</p>

<p>Verbs have two voices, like the gentleman who was singing,
a&nbsp;short time since, at the St. James’s Theatre.</p>

<p>The active ending in <i>o</i>&mdash;as amo, I&nbsp;love.</p>

<p>The passive ending in <i>or</i>&mdash;as amor, I&nbsp;am loved.</p>

<p>In these two words is contained the terrestrial summum bonum&mdash;In
short, love beats everything&mdash;cock-fighting not excepted. Amo!
amor! How happy every human being, from the peer to the pot-boy, from
the duchess to the dairy-maid, would be to be able to say so.</p>

<p>They would <i>conjugate</i> immediately. Except, however, certain
modern political economists of the Malthusian school, who, albeit they
are great advocates for the diffusion of learning, are violently opposed
to unlimited conjugations.</p>

<p>Of verbs ending in <i>o</i> some are actives transitive. A verb is
called transitive when the action passes
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
on to the following noun, as Seco baculum meum, I cut my stick.</p>

<p>Numerous examples of this kind of cutting, which may be called a
<i>comic section</i>, are recorded in history, both ancient and modern.
Even Hector cut his stick (with Achilles after him) at the siege of
Troy. The Persians cut their stick at Marathon. Pompey cut his stick at
Pharsalia, and so did Antony at Actium. Napoleon Bonaparte cut his stick
at Waterloo.</p>

<p>Other verbs ending in <i>o</i> are named neuters and intransitives.
A&nbsp;verb is called intransitive, or neuter, when the action does not
pass on, or require a following noun, as curro, I&nbsp;run. Pistol
cucurrit, Pistol ran. But to say, “Falstaff voluit <i>currere eum
per</i>,” “Falstaff wished <i>to run him through</i>,” would be making a
neuter verb, a&nbsp;verb active, and would therefore be Latin of the
canine species, or Dog-Latin; so would Meus homo Gulielmus <i>cucurrit
caput suum</i> plenum sed contra te homo dic pax, My man William <i>ran
his head</i> full but against the mantel-piece. This, it is obvious,
will not do after Cicero.</p>

<p>Verbs transitive ending in <i>o</i> become passive by changing
<i>o</i> into <i>or</i>, as Secor, I&nbsp;am cut. Cæsar was cut by his
friend Brutus in the capitol. “This,” as Antony very judiciously
observed on the hustings, “was the most unkindest <i>cut</i> of
all,”&mdash;much worse,
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
indeed, than any of the similar operations which are daily performed in
Regent Street.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic40.png" width = "257" height = "336"
alt = "two black men"></p>

<p class = "caption">
BRUTUS AND CÆSAR.</p>

<p>Verbs neuter and intransitive are never made passive. We may say,
Crepo, I&nbsp;crack, but we cannot say, Crepor, I&nbsp;am cracked.</p>

<p>The ancient heroes appear, from what Homer says, to have got into a
way of <i>cracking</i> away most tremendously when they were going to
engage in single combat.</p>

<p>Orestes was certainly <i>cracked</i>.</p>

<p>Some verbs ending in <i>or</i> have an active signification&mdash;as
Loquor, I&nbsp;speak.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<p><i>Q.</i> Why are such verbs like witnesses on oath?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because they are called “Deponents.”</p>

<p>Of these some few are neuters, as Glorior, I&nbsp;boast.</p>

<p>Cæsar boasted that he came, saw, and overcame. Bald-headed people
(like Cæsar) do not, in general, make <i>conquests</i> so easily.</p>

<p>Neuter Verbs ending in <i>or</i>, and verbs deponent, are declined
like verbs passive; but with gerunds and supines like verbs active; thus
presenting a curious combination of <i>activity</i> and
<i>supineness</i>.</p>

<p>There are some verbs which are called verbs personal. A&nbsp;verb
personal resembles a mixed group of old maids and young maids, because
it has <i>different persons</i>, as Ego irrideo, I&nbsp;quiz. Tu
irrides, thou quizzest.</p>

<p>A verb impersonal is like a collection of tombstone angels, or small
children; it has not <i>different persons</i>, as <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘tædat’">tædet</ins>, it irketh,
oportet, it behoveth.</p>

<p>It irketh to learn Greek and Latin, nevertheless it behoveth to do
so.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<h4>OF MOODS.</h4>

<p>Moods in verbs are like moods in man, they have each of them a
peculiar <i>expression</i>. Here,
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
however, the resemblance stops. Man has many moods, verbs have but five.
For instance, we observe in men the merry mood, the doleful mood, (or
dumps), the shy, timid, or sheepish mood, the bold, or <i>bumptious</i>
mood, the placid mood, the angry mood, whereto may be added the
vindictive mood, and the sulky mood; the sober mood, as
contradistinguished from both the serious and the drunken mood; or as
blended with the latter, in which case it may be called the sober-drunk
mood&mdash;the contented mood, the grumbling mood; the sympathetic mood,
the sarcastic mood, the idle mood, the working mood, the communicative
mood, the secretive mood, and the moods of all the phrenological organs;
besides the monitory or mentorial mood, and the mendacious, or lying
mood, with the imaginative, poetical, or romantic mood, the
compassionate, or melting mood, and many other moods too tedious to
mention.</p>

<table class = "figfloat" summary = "illustration">
<tr><td>
<img src = "images/pic43.png" width = "192" height = "339"
alt = "very tall man talking to woman on ladder"><br>
A LONG COURTSHIP.
</td></tr>
</table>

<p>We must not however omit the flirting mood, the teazing or
tantalizing mood, the giggling mood, the <ins class = "correction" title
= "probably error for ‘nagging’">magging</ins> or talkative mood, and
the scandalizing mood, which are peculiarly observable in the fair
sex.</p>

<p>The moods of verbs are the following:</p>

<p>1. The indicative mood, which either affirms a fact or asks a
question, as Ego amo, I&nbsp;<i>do</i> love. Amas tu? <i>Dost</i> thou
love?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<p>The long and short of all courtships are contained in these two
examples.</p>

<p>2. The imperative mood, which commandeth, or entreateth. This
two-fold character of the imperative mood is often exemplified in
schools, the command being on the part of the master, and the entreaty
on that of the boy&mdash;as thus, Veni huc! Come hither! Parce mihi!
Spare me! The imperative mood is also known by the sign
<i>let</i>&mdash;as in the well-known verse in the song Dulce
Domum&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">“Eja! nunc eamus.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! now let us be off”&mdash;meaning for the vacation. N.B. This
mood is one much in the
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
mouth of beadles, boatswains, bashaws, majors, magistrates, slave
drivers, superintendents, serjeants, and jacks-in-office of all
descriptions&mdash;monitors, especially, and præfects of public schools,
are very fond of using it on all occasions.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic44.png" width = "328" height = "262"
alt = "uniformed man chasing boys"></p>

<p class = "caption">
THE IMPERATIVE MOOD.</p>

<p>3. The potential mood signifies power or duty. The signs by which it
is known are, may, can, might, would, could, should, or ought&mdash;as,
Amem, I&nbsp;may love (when I leave school). <ins class = "correction"
title = "text reads ‘Amivissem’">Amavissem</ins>, I&nbsp;should have
loved (if I had not known better,) and the like.</p>

<p>4. The subjunctive differs from the potential only in being always
governed by some conjunction or indefinite word, and in being subjoined
to some other verb going before it in the same sentence&mdash;as
Cochleare eram cum amarem, I&nbsp;was a <i>spoon</i> when
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
I loved&mdash;Nescio qualis sim hoc ipso tempore, I&nbsp;don’t know what
sort of a person I am at this very time.</p>

<p>The propriety of the above expression “cochleare,” will be explained
in a Comic System of Rhetoric, which perhaps may appear hereafter.</p>

<p>5. The infinitive mood is like a gentleman’s cab, because it has no
number.</p>

<p>We have not made up our minds exactly, whether to compare it to the
“picture of nobody” mentioned in the Tempest, or to the “picture of
ugliness,” which young ladies generally call their successful rivals. It
may be like one, or the other, or both, because it has no
<i>person</i>.</p>

<p>Neither has it a nominative case before it; nor, indeed, has it any
more business with one than a toad has with a side pocket.</p>

<p>It is commonly known by the sign <i>to</i>. As, for
example&mdash;Amare, to love; Desipere, to be a fool; Nubere, to marry;
Pœnitere, to repent.</p>

<h4>OF GERUNDS AND SUPINES.</h4>

general a cultivation as possible of the various faculties, we beg to

<h4>OF TENSES.</h4>

<p>In verbs there are five tenses, or times, expressing an action, or
affirmation.</p>

<p>1. The present tense, or time. There is no time (or tense) like the
present. It expresses an action now taking place. Examples&mdash;
<i>Act.</i> I love, or am loving. Amo, I&nbsp;am loving.
&mdash;<i>Pass.</i> I am made drunk, or am drunk. Inebrior, I&nbsp;am
drunk.</p>

<p>2. The preterimperfect tense denotes something, or a state of things,
partly, but not entirely
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
past. &mdash;Examp. I&nbsp;did love or was loving. Amabam, I was loving.
I&nbsp;was made drunk an hour ago. Inebriabar, I&nbsp;was made
drunk.</p>

<p>3. The preterperfect tense expresses a thing lately done, but now
ended. &mdash;Examp. I&nbsp;have loved, or I loved. Amavi, I&nbsp;loved.
I&nbsp;have been made drunk, or have been drunk. Inebriatus sum,
I&nbsp;have been drunk.</p>

<p>4. The preterpluperfect tense refers to a thing done at some time
past, but now ended. &mdash;Examp. Amaveram, I&nbsp;had loved.
Inebriatus eram, I&nbsp;had been drunk.</p>

<p>5. The future tense relates to a thing to be done hereafter, as,
Amabo, I&nbsp;shall or will love<ins class = "correction" title = ". missing">. </ins>Inebriabor, I shall get drunk&mdash;say to-morrow.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<h4>OF NUMBERS AND PERSONS.</h4>

<p>Verbs have two numbers. No. 1, Singular, No.&nbsp;2, Plural.</p>

<p>In most matters it is usual to pay exclusive attention to number one.
In learning the verbs, however, it is necessary to regard equally number
two.&mdash;The <i>persons</i> of verbs are generally considered very
disagreeable. Verbs have three persons in each number. Thus, for
instance, at a dancing academy&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<table class = "grammar" summary = "table of inflections">
<tr>
<td>Sing.</td>

<tr>
<td>Plur.</td>
<td>Nos saltamus,<br>
Vos saltatis,<br>
Illi saltant,</td>
<td>We dance,<br>
Ye dance,<br>
They dance.</td>

</table>

<p>At an academy on <i>Free-knowledge-ical</i> principles&mdash;or a
Comic Academy.</p>

<table class = "grammar" summary = "table of inflections">

<td></td>
<td>Nos ridemus,<br>
Vos ridetis.<br>
Illi rident,</td>
<td>We laugh,<br>
Ye laugh,<br>
They laugh.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Laughter, too, is very common at other academies, but generally
occurs on the wrong side of the mouth. The right sort of laughter (which
may be presumed to be on the <i>right</i> side of the mouth), is most
frequent about the time of the holidays. What does the song say?</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Ridet annus, prata rident</p>
<p class = "indent">
Nosque rideamus.”</p>
</div>

<p class = "grammar">
“The year laughs, the meadows laugh,&mdash;suppose we have a laugh as
well.”</p>

<p><i>Note</i>&mdash;That all nouns are of the third person except Ego,
Nos, Tu, and Vos. Hence we see
<span class = "pagenum">49</span>
how absurdly the man who drew a couple of donkeys acted in endeavouring
to prevail upon <i>us</i> to call the picture “<i>We</i>
Three”&mdash;<i>Ille</i>, <i>he</i>,&mdash;may, perhaps, have been
qualified to make a <i>third person</i> in the group, and have “written
himself down an ass” with some correctness. <i>Ego</i>, <i>I</i>, and
<i>Nos</i>, <i>we</i>, have certainly nothing in common with that
animal, and it is to be hoped that neither Tu, thou, nor Vos, ye, can be
said to partake of his nature.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> also. That all nouns of the vocative case are of the
second person. So that if we should say, O&nbsp;asine, O&nbsp;thou
donkey; or O asini, O&nbsp;ye donkeys, we should have grammar at least
on our side.</p>

<p>Be it your care to prevent us from having justice also.</p>


<h5>Of the Verb Esse, to be.</h5>

<p>Before other verbs are declined, it is necessary to learn the verb
Esse, to be. And before we teach the verb Esse, to be, it is necessary
to make a few remarks on verbs in general.</p>

<p>In the first place we have to observe, that they are rather
difficult; and in the next, that if any one expects that we are going to
consider them in detail, he is very much mistaken.</p>

<p>But our skipping a very considerable portion of the verbs, is no
reason why boys should do the
<span class = "pagenum">50</span>
same. Were we all to follow the examples of our teachers, instead of
attending to their precepts, where would be the world by this time?</p>

<p>Whirling away, no doubt, far from the respectable society of the
neighbouring planets, and blundering about right and left, pell-mell,
helter-skelter among the fixed stars&mdash;itself, “and all which it
inherit” in that glorious state of confusion so admirably described by
the poet Ovid&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Quem dixere Chaos,”</p>

<p>which men have called Shaos. It would indeed be little better than a
broken down <i>Shay</i>-horse.</p>

<p>But “revenons à nos moutons,” that is, let us get back to our verbs.
We recommend the most attentive and diligent study of all of them as set
forth in the Eton Grammar, assisted by that kind of association of
ideas, of which we shall now proceed to give a few specimens.</p>

<p>Sum, es, fui, esse, futurus, to be,&mdash;or not to be&mdash;that is
the question.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> 1. To each person of a verb, singular and plural, join a
noun, according to your taste or comic talent. Should you be deficient
in the inventive faculty, apply for assistance to one of the senior
boys, which, in consideration of your fagging for him, he will readily
give you. If yourself a senior boy, apply to the master.</p>

<p><i>Rule</i> 2. In repeating the different tenses of verbs, be careful

another to rhyme with the third person plural. In this way your powers

<h5>Verbs Irregular&mdash;</h5>

<p>Are <i>regular</i> bores. The above Rules are equally applicable to
them, and also to the</p>


<h5>Defective Verbs;</h5>

<p>Concerning which it may be asserted, that though almost all of them
have tenses more or less imperfect, there are some which have not a
single <i>Imperfect Tense</i>.</p>


<h5>Impersonal Verbs.</h5>

<p>Such as delectat, it delighteth; decet, it becometh, &amp;c., answer
to such English verbs as take the word <i>it</i> before them. When we
consider that <i>it</i> is
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
a term of endearment used in speaking to babies, as “it’s a pretty
dear,” we cannot help thinking that Verbs Impersonal ought to be
<i>pet</i> verbs. Such however, is not, as far as we know, the fact.</p>

<h4>OF A PARTICIPLE.</h4>

<p>A participle is a hybrid part of speech; a&nbsp;kind of
mongrel-cross, between a noun and a verb. It is two parts verbs, and
four parts noun; wherefore its composition may be likened unto the milk
sold in and about London, which is usually watered in the proportion of
four to two. The properties of the noun belonging to it, are, number,
gender, case, and declension; those of the verb, tense, and
signification.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<p>As a horse hath four legs, so hath a verb four participles.</p>

<h6><i>Air.</i>&mdash;Bonnets of Blue.</h6>

<div class = "verse">
<p>There&nbsp;’s one of the present,&mdash;and then,</p>
<p class = "indent">
There&nbsp;’s one of the future in <i>rus</i>;</p>
<p>Of the tense preterperfect a third,&mdash;and again,</p>
<p class = "indent">
A fourth of the future in <i>dus</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Participles are declined like nouns adjective, as&mdash;but no! how
can we ask our fair (blue) readers to decline <i>a-man’s</i> (amans)
loving.</p>

<p>Now here we feel called upon to say a few words on the difference
between a man’s loving and a woman’s loving. It has often been a
question, whether do men or women love most <i>dearly</i>? To us the
matter does not appear to admit of a doubt. We defy any of our male
readers to be in love (when they are old and silly enough) for six
months without finding themselves most grievously out of pocket. We have
a friend who was in that unfortunate condition for about a month, and it
cost him at least seven and sixpence a week in fees to the maid servant,
and that without once being enabled to exchange a word with the object
of his affections. At last he began to think that he was paying rather
too dear for his whistle; so he gave it up. What girl would have held on
so long, and laid out so much money without a return&mdash;
<span class = "pagenum">56</span>
not of soft affection, but of hard cash? Women, indeed, instead of
loving dearly, love, according to our own experience, particularly
cheaply. Think of what they save, by taking their admirers “shopping”
with them, in ribands, bracelets, and the like, to say nothing of
coach-hire, pastry-cooks, and the price of admission, when they go with
them to the play. And we should like to hear of the young lady who in
these days would dispose of her hand at any thing less than a good round
sum if she could help it&mdash;no, no. To love <i>dearly</i> is the
precious prerogative of the lords of the creation alone.</p>

<p>But we are forgetting our participles.</p>

<p>The participle of the present tense ends in <i>ans</i>, or
<i>ens</i>; as Flagellans, whipping; Lædens, hurting.</p>

<p>That of the future in <i>rus</i>, signifies a likelihood, or design
of doing something, as Flagellaturus, about to whip; Læsurus, about to
hurt.</p>

<p>That of the preterperfect tense has generally a passive
signification, and ends in <i>us</i>, as Flagellatus, whipped; Læsus,
hurt.</p>

<p>That of the future in <i>dus</i> has also a passive signification, as
Flagellandus, to be whipped; Lædendus, to be hurt.</p>

<p><i>Note</i> 1. All participles are declined like nouns adjective. We
recommend the above participles to be declined like <i>winking</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">57</span>

whipping&mdash;a&nbsp;top, a&nbsp;syllabub, and a cream.</p>

<h4>OF AN ADVERB.</h4>

<p>Convex and concave spectacles are contrivances used to increase or
diminish the magnitude of objects.</p>

<p>Adverbs are parts of speech used to increase or diminish the
signification of words.</p>

<p>Spectacles are joined to the bridge of the nose.</p>

<p>Adverbs are joined to nouns adjective, and verbs. Benè, well; multùm,
much; malè, ill, &amp;c. are adverbs.</p>

<h4>OF A CONJUNCTION.</h4>

<p>A conjunction is a part of speech that joineth together; wherefore it
may be likened unto many things; for instance&mdash;</p>

<p>To glue, to paste, to gum arabic, to mortar, (for it joins words and
sentences together <i>like bricks</i>), to Roman cement, (<i>Latin</i>
conjunctions more especially), to white of egg, to isinglass, to putty,
to adhesive plaster, to matrimony.</p>

<p>Conjunctions are thus used.</p>

<p>Ova <i>et</i> lardum, eggs and bacon. Dimidium dimidium<i>que</i>,
half-and-half. Amor <i>et</i> dementia, love and madness.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">59</span>

<h4>OF A PREPOSITION.</h4>

<p>A Preposition is a part of speech commonly <i>set before</i> another
word. Words, however, do not eat each other, though men have been known
to eat words. Ab, ad, ante, &amp;c. <ins class = "correction" title =
"missing ‘are’?">prepositions</ins>.</p>

<p>Sometimes a preposition is joined in composition with another word,
as <i>pro</i>stratus, knocked down&mdash;floored.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Tullius ab aquario <i>pro</i>stratus est:</p>

<p>Tully was knocked down by a waterman.</p>
</div>

<hr class = "micro">

<h4>OF AN INTERJECTION.</h4>

<p>An interjection is a word expressing a sudden emotion or feeling, as
Hei! Oh dear!&mdash;Heu! Lack-a-day!<ins class = "correction" title =
"-- missing">&mdash;</ins>Hem! Brute, Hollo! Brutus.&mdash;Euge! Tite,
Bravo! Titus.</p>

<p>We here find ourselves approaching the delightful subject of the
three Concords, with which we shall make short work, first, for fear of
further <i>Accidence</i>, and, secondly, because we are no fonder than
boys are of <i>repetitions</i>, which, were we to follow the Eton
Grammar in the Concords, we should be obliged to make in the Syntax.</p>

<p>However, there are just one or two points to be mentioned.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<p><i>Rule.</i> (Text-hand copy-books.) “Ask no questions.”</p>

<p><i>Exception.</i> When you want to find where the concord should be,
ask the following&mdash;</p>

<p>Who? or what?&mdash;to find the nominative case to the verb.</p>

<p>Whom? or what? with the verb, for the accusative after it.</p>

<p>Who? or what? with the adjective, for the substantive to the
adjective.</p>

<p>Who? or what? with the verb, for the antecedent to the relative.</p>

<p>But remember, that the use of the interrogatives who? and what?
however justifiable in grammar, is very impertinent in conversation.
What, for example, can be more ill-bred than to say, Who are you?
Indeed, most questions are ill mannered. We do not speak of such
expressions as, Has your mother sold her mangle? and the like, used only
by persons who have never asked themselves where they expect to go to?
but of all unnecessary demands whatever. “Sir,” said the great Dr<ins
class = "correction" title = ". invisible">.&nbsp;</ins>Johnson, “it is
uncivil to be continually asking, Why is a dog’s tail short, or why is a
cow’s tail long.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">61</span>

<h4>OF THE GENDERS OF NOUNS,</h4>

<h6>Commonly known by the name of</h6>

<h5 class = "ital">“Propria Quæ Maribus.”</h5>

<p>As the “Propria Quæ Maribus” is no joke, and the “As in Præsenti” is
too much of a joke, we must do with them as we did with the verbs.
Singing a song is always esteemed a valid substitute for telling a
story; and the indulgence which we would have extended to us in this
respect, is that universally granted to civilized society.</p>

<p>Let the “Propria Quæ Maribus” be turned into a series of exercises,
thus, or in like manner&mdash;</p>

perfectly original. The genuine
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
Propria Quæ Maribus, and As in Præsenti, like the writings of the most
remote antiquity, consist of certain useful truths recorded in
harmonious numbers. It has been a question among commentators, whether
these interesting compositions were originally intended to be said or
sung. Analogy (we mean that derived from the works of Homer and Virgil)
would incline us to the latter opinion, which however does not appear to
have been generally entertained in the schools. We shall give one more
specimen in the above style; and we beg it may be remembered, that in so
doing, we have no wish to detract in any way from the merit of the
illustrious poet in the Eton Grammar; all we think is, that he might
have introduced a little more <i>comicality</i> into his work, while he
was about it.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<p>However, a verb personal agrees with its nominative case in number

<p><i>You</i> ’re a nice man, <i>you</i> are.</p>

<p>Who can doubt it? But, besides, we have much to say in praise of
boxing. In the first place, it is a <i>classical</i> accomplishment. To
say nothing of the Olympic and Isthmian Games, which are of themselves
sufficient proof of the elegant and <i>fanciful</i> tastes of the
ancients; we need only allude to the fact, that the <i>Corinthians</i>
are universally celebrated for their proficiency in this science. Then,
of its eminently <i>social</i> tendency, there can be no doubt. What can
be more conducive to good fellowship, and conviviality than the frequent
<i>tapping of claret</i>, attendant both on its study and practice? Nor
can its beneficial influence on the fine arts be called in question,
seeing that its immediate object is to teach us the <i>use of our
hands</i>. And (which perhaps is the most <ins class = "notation" title

particularly pleasing to the fair sex, who besides their well known
admiration of <i>bravery</i>, are, to a woman, devotedly attached to the

<p>Sometimes an adverb with a genitive case stands in the place of the

<h5>Exceptions to the Rule.</h5>

scarcely any rule without an exception; and this axiom particularly
applies to the Syntax. We used to wish it did not; because then we
should not have had so much to learn&mdash;to resume however&mdash;</p>

<p>Verbs of the infinitive mood often have set before them an accusative
case instead of a nominative; the conjunction quod, or ut, being left

<h5>Construction of Nouns Substantive.</h5>

<p>Which is not quite so amusing as the construction of small boats,
paper kites, pinwheels, crackers, or any other mode of displaying the
faculty of “constructiveness”&mdash;though in one sense the construction
of nouns substantive, is not unlike the construction of
<i>puzzles</i>.</p>

<p>When two substantives of a different signification meet together, the
latter is put in the genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ulysses lumen Cyclopis extinxit:</p>

<p>Ulysses doused the glim of the Cyclops.</p>
</div>

<p>This genitive case is sometimes changed into a dative, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Urbi pater est, urbique maritus. &mdash;Gram. Eton.</p>

<p>He is the father of the city, and the husband of the city.</p>
</div>

<p>He must have been a pretty fellow, whoever he was.</p>

<p>An adjective of the neuter gender, put without a substantive,
sometimes requires a genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Paululùm honestatis sartori sufficit:</p>

<p>A very little honesty is enough for a tailor.</p>
</div>

<p>A genitive case is sometimes placed alone; the preceding substantive
being understood by the figure ellipsis, as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">74</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ubi ad magistri veneris, cave verbum de porco:</p>

<p>When you are come to the master’s (house), not a word about the
pig.</p>
</div>

<p>The word pig is a very general term, and is used to signify not only
the animal so called, and such of the human race as resemble him in
habits, appearance, or feelings; but also to denote a variety of little
things, which it is sometimes necessary to keep secret. A&nbsp;pedagogue
now and then discovers a <i>pig-tail</i> appended to his coat
collar&mdash;this, or rather the way in which it got there, is one of
the little <i>pigs</i> in question. Robbing the larder or the garden is
another; so is insinuating horse-hairs into the cane, or putting
cobbler’s wax on the seat of learning &mdash;we mean the master’s stool.
A&nbsp;sort of <i>pig</i> (or rather a <i>rat</i>) is sometimes
<i>smelt</i> by the master on taking his nightly walk though the
dormitories, when roast fowl, mince pies, bread and cheese, shrub,
punch, &amp;c. have been slyly smuggled into those places of repose.
Shirking down town is always a <i>pig</i>, and the consequences thereof,
in case of discovery, a great <i>bore</i>.</p>

<p>Considering that a secret is a <i>pig</i>, it is singular that
betraying one should be called letting the <i>cat</i> out of the
bag.</p>

</div>

<p>By the way, what a nice young man Virgil makes out Marcellus to have

<p>Praise, dispraise, or the quality of a thing is placed in the
ablative, and also in the genitive case&mdash;as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

the genitive case after the adjective.</h5>

<p>Adjectives which signify desire, knowledge, memory, fear, and the
contrary to these, require a genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Est natura vetularum obtrectationis avida:</p>

<p>The nature of old women is fond of scandal.</p>
</div>

<p>This particularly applies to old maids. As those delightful creatures
now-a-days, not content with being <i>grey</i> aspire to be actually
<i>blue</i>; we cannot help recommending to them a kind of study, for
which their propensity to <i>cutting up</i> renders them peculiarly
adapted; we mean <i>Anatomy</i>. And since it is on the foulest and most
odious points of character that they chiefly delight to dwell, we
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
more especially suggest to them the pursuit of <i>Morbid Anatomy</i>, as
one which is likely to be attended both with gratification and

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Mens tempestatum præscia:</p>

<p>A mind foreknowing the weather.</p>
</div>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Immemor beneficii:</p>

</div>

<p>The sort of kindness one is least likely to forget is that which our

learning by means of the rod. We cannot help thinking, however, that he
began <i>at the wrong end</i>.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Imperitus rerum:</p>

<p>Unacquainted with the world, i.e. Not ‘up to snuff’.</p>
</div>

<p>Much controversy has been wasted in attempts to determine the origin
of the phrase “up to snuff”. Some have contended that it was suggested
by the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘well-know’">well-known</ins> quality possessed by snuff, of <i>clearing
the head</i>; but this idea is far fetched, not to say absurd. Others
will have that the expression was derived from Snofe, or Snoffe, the
name of a cunning rogue who flourished about the time of the first
crusade; so that “up to Snoffe” signified as clever, or knowing, as
Snoffe; and was in process of time
<span class = "pagenum">78</span>
converted into “up to snuff.” This opinion is deserving of notice;
though the only argument in its favour is, that the phrase in question
was in vogue long before the discovery of tobacco. Probably the soundest
view is that which connects it with the proper name Znoufe, which in
ancient High-Dutch is equivalent to Mercury, whose reputation for
astuteness among the ancients was exceedingly great. Conf. Hookey-Walk,
ii.&nbsp;13. Hok. Pok. Wonk-Fum. viii.&nbsp;24. Cheek. Marin. passim,
with a host of commentators, ancient and modern.</p>

<p>Roscius timidus Deorum fuit:</p>

<p><i>Roscius</i> was afraid of the <i>Gods</i>.</p>

<p>Adjectives ending in <i>ax</i>, derived from verbs, also require a
genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Tempus edax rerum:</p>

<p>Time is the consumer of all things.</p>
</div>

<p>Hence Time is sometimes figured as an alderman.</p>

<p>Nouns partitive, nouns of number, nouns comparative and superlative,
and certain adjectives put partitively, require a genitive case, from
which also they take their gender; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Utrum horum mavis accipe:</p>

<p>Take which of those two things you had rather.</p>
</div>

<p>So Queen Eleanor gave Fair Rosamond her choice between the dagger and

</div>

<p>Namely, the aforesaid Momus. He is the only heathen god that we
should have had much reverence for, and certainly the only one that we
should ever have sacrificed to at all. The offering most commonly made
to the god of laughter was, probably, <i>a&nbsp;sacrifice of
propriety</i>.</p>

<p>But the above nouns are also used with these prepositions, a, ab, de,
e, ex, inter, ante; as,</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Primus inter philosophos Democritus est:</p>

<p>Democritus is the first amongst philosophers.</p>
</div>

<p>And why? Because he alone was wise enough to find out that laughing
is better than crying. He it was who first proved to the world that
philosophy and comicality are, in fact, one science; and that the more
we learn the more we laugh. We forget whether it was he or Aristotle who
made the remark, that man is the only laughing animal except the
hyæna.</p>

<h5>The Dative Case after the Adjective.</h5>

<p>Adjectives by which advantage, disadvantage, likeness, unlikeness,
pleasure, submission, or relation to any thing is signified, require a
dative case; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Astaci incocti patriæ idonei sunt in pace; cocti autem in bello.</p>

<p>Raw lobsters are serviceable to their country in peace; but boiled
ones in war. Lobster’s <i>claws</i> are nasty things to get into.</p>
</div>

<p>The Corporation of London seemed very much afraid of the <i>Police
clause</i>.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why a soldier is sometimes called a lobster,
probably is, that the latter is a <i>marine</i> animal.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Balænæ persimile:</p>

<p>Very like a whale.</p>

<p>Qui color albus erat nunc est contrarius albo:</p>

<p>The colour which was white is now contrary to white.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">82</span>

who will do this, though he may not always be&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Jucundus amicis:</p>

<p>Pleasant to his friends;</p>
</div>

<p>is nevertheless frequently so to his <i>constituents</i>.</p>

<p>Hither are referred nouns compounded of the preposition <i>con</i>,
as contubernalis, a&nbsp;comrade; commilito, a fellow soldier, &amp;c.
You must <i>con</i> all such words attentively before you can
<i>con</i>strue well, or the <i>con</i>sequence will be, that you will
be <i>con</i>siderably blown up, if not <i>con</i>foundedly flogged.</p>

<p>Some of these which signify similitude, are also joined to a genitive
case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Par uncti fulminis:</p>

<p>Like greased lightning.</p>
</div>

<p>The familiarity of our transatlantic friends with the nature of the

Franklin. <i>Q.</i>&nbsp;Was the lightning which that philosopher drew
down from the clouds, of the kind mentioned in the example?</p>

<p>Communis, common; alienus, strange; immunis, free, are joined to a
genitive, dative, and also to an ablative case, with a preposition,
as</p>

<p>Natus, born; commodus, convenient; incommodus, inconvenient; utilis,
useful; inutilis, useless; vehemens, earnest; aptus, fit, are sometimes
also joined to an accusative case with a preposition, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Natus ad laqueum:</p>

<p>Born to a halter.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<p>Those who are reserved for this exalted destiny, are said to enjoy a

<p>To prevent mistakes, it should be mentioned, that the <i>watermen</i>
here meant are those who, by their own account, are so called from their
office being <i>to shut the doors of hackney coaches</i>.</p>

<p>Verbal adjectives ending in <i>bilis</i>, taken passively, and
participles made adjectives ending in <i>dus</i>, require a dative case;
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Nulli penetrabilis astro;</p>

<p>Penetrable by no <i>star</i>&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>not fond of <i>acting</i>?</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>O venerande mihi Liston! te luget Olympus:</p>

<p>O Liston, to be venerated by me the <i>Olympic</i> bewails thee.</p>
</div>


<h5>The Accusative Case after the Adjective.</h5>

<p>The measure of quantity is put after adjectives, in the accusative,
the ablative, and the genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

<p>An accusative case is sometimes put after adjectives and participles,

<div class = "grammar">

<p>Like to a cod-fish as to his head and shoulders.</p>
</div>

<p>Some men <i>are</i> exceedingly like a cod-fish, as to their head and
shoulders, and they often endeavour to increase this natural resemblance
as much as possible, by wearing <i>gills</i>.</p>


<h5>The Ablative Case after the Adjective.</h5>

<p>Adjectives which relate to plenty or want, sometimes require an
ablative, sometimes a genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Amor et melle et felle est fœcundissimus:</p>

<p>Love is very full both of honey and gall.</p>

very <i>galling</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly. In lover’s sighs, to which it communicates their peculiar

<p>Thirdly. Another very <i>galling</i> thing in love is being cut

<p>Adjectives and <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘subsantives’">substantives</ins> govern an ablative case, signifying

the angle</i>, on account of their partiality to the <i>rod</i>. Does
the reader <i>twig</i>? If so, it is unnecessary to <i>branch</i> out
into a discussion with regard to the nature of the barbarity hinted
at&mdash;a&nbsp;kind of barbarity which, though it may proclaim its
perpetrators to be by no means allied to the <i>feline</i> race,
connects them most decidedly with the <i>canine</i> species.</p>

<p>Dignus, worthy; indignus, unworthy; præditus,

endued; captus, disabled; contentus, content; extorris, banished;
fretus, relying upon; liber, free; with adjectives signifying price,
require an ablative case, as</p>

Hellespont&mdash;but no matter. What a <i>goose</i> he must have been
considered by any one else who happened to know of his nightly exploits!
How miserably he was <i>gulled</i> at last! Never mind. If Leander went

<p>Tanto, by so much, quanto, by how much, hoc, by this, eo, by this,
and quo, by which; with some other words which signify the measure of
exceeding; likewise ætate, by age, and natu, by birth, are often joined

<h5>The Construction of Pronouns.</h5>

<p>All those who would understand the construction of pronouns, should
take care to be well versed in the distinction between <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum</i>, ignorance of which often gives rise to the disagreeable
necessity of becoming too intimately acquainted with <i>quod</i>.</p>

<p>Mei, of me, tui, of thee, sui, of himself, nostri, of us, vestri, of
you, (the genitive cases of their primitives ego, tu, &amp;c.) are used
when a person is signified, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Languet desiderio tui:</p>

<p>He languishes for want of you.</p>
</div>

<p>You cannot give a more acceptable piece of information than the
above, to any young lady. The fairer and more amiable sex always like to
have something&mdash;if not to love, at least to pity.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Parsque tui lateat corpore clausa meo. &mdash;<i>Eton Gram.</i></p>

<p>And a part of you may lie shut up in my body.</p>

<p>Meus, mine, tuus, thine, suus, his own (Cocknicè his’n<ins class =
"correction" title = ") missing">),</ins> noster, ours, vester, yours,
are used when action, or the possession of a thing is signified; as</p>

<div class = "verse">

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic92.png" width = "293" height = "168"
alt = "boy picking pocket caught by second man"></p>

<p>These possessive pronouns, meus, tuus, suus, noster, and vester, take
after them these genitive cases,&mdash;ipsius, of himself, solius, of
him alone, unius, of one, duorum, of two, trium, of three, <ins class =
"correction" title = ", missing">&amp;c.,</ins> omnium, of all, plurium,
of more, paucorum, of few, cujusque, of every one, and also the genitive
cases of participles, which are referred to the primitive word
understood; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Meis unius impensis pocula sex exhausi:</p>

<p>I drank six pots to my own cheek.</p>
</div>

<p>We wonder that any one should have the <i>face</i> to say so.</p>

<p>Sui and suus are reciprocal pronouns, that is, they have always
relation to that which went before, and was most to be noted in the
sentence, as&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">93</span>

that you would not laugh at him.</p>
</div>

<p>If you <i>do</i>, take care that he does not <i>blow you up</i> one

<p>These demonstrative pronouns, hic, iste, and ille are thus
distinguished: hic points out the nearest to me; iste him who is by you;
ille him who is at a distance from both of us.</p>

<p>In making <i>game</i> of the Syntax, we regard them as
<i>pointers</i>.</p>

<p>When hic and ille are referred to two things or persons going before,
hic generally relates to the latter, ille to the former, as</p>

<div class = "verse">

<h5>The Construction of Verbs.<br>
The Nominative Case after the Verb.</h5>

<p>Verbs substantive, as sum, I am, forem, I&nbsp;might be, fio,
I&nbsp;am made, existo, I&nbsp;am; verbs passive of calling, as nominor,
I&nbsp;am named, appellor, I&nbsp;am called, dicor, I&nbsp;am said,
vocor, I&nbsp;am called, nuncupor,
<span class = "pagenum">94</span>
I am named, and the like to them, as videor, I am seen, habeor,
I&nbsp;am accounted, existimor, I&nbsp;am thought, have the same cases
before and after them, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

<p>Even among the ancients, <i>turtles</i> were the emblems of love;
which, next to eating and drinking, has always been the first object of
human pursuit. This fact proves, very satisfactorily, two things, first,
their proficiency in the science of gastronomy; and, secondly, their
extreme susceptibility of the tender passion.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Pileus vocatur tegula:</p>

<p>A hat is called a tile.</p>
</div>

<p>Likewise all verbs in a manner admit after them an adjective, which
agrees with the nominative case of the verb, in case, gender, and
number, as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">95</span>

<p>Is this a sly rap at the Quakers?</p>


<h5>The Genitive Case after the Verb.</h5>

<p>Sum requires a genitive case as often as it signifies possession,
duty, sign, or that which relates to any thing; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Quod rapidam trahit Ætatem pecus est Melibœi,</p>

<p>These nominative cases are excepted from the above rule, meum, mine,
tuum, thine, suum, his, noster, our, vester, your, humanum, human,
belluinum brutal, and the like, as</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Love is like a dizziness,</p>
<p>Never lets a poor man go about his business.”</p>
</div>

<p>Verbs of accusing, condemning, advising, acquitting, and the like,
require a genitive case which signifies the charge; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Qui alterum accusat probri, eum ipsum se intueri oportet.</p>

<p>We do not see much <i>fun</i> in that. We cannot help thinking,

<p>Put the master in mind of his seedy clothes.</p>

<p>That is if you want a <i>good dressing</i>.</p>

<p>This genitive case is sometimes changed into an ablative, either with

manner.</p>

<p>Uterque, both, nullus, none, alter, the other, neuter, neither of the
two, alius, another, ambo, both, and the superlative degree, are joined
to verbs of that kind only in the ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Fratris, an asini, trucidationis accusas me? Utroque, sed sceleris
unius:</p>

<p>Do you accuse me of killing my brother or my donkey? Of both; but of

</div>

<p>Satago, to be busy about a thing, misereor and miseresco, to pity,
require a genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Qui ducit uxorem rerum satagit:</p>

<p>Reminiscor, to remember, obliviscor, to forget, memini, to remember,
recorder, to call to mind, admit a genitive or accusative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Reminiscere nonarum Novembrium:</p>

<p>Remember the fifth of November.</p>

<p>No wonder that so many <i>squibs</i> are let off on that

coachman in one respect especially resembles a lover; he always wishes
to be remembered by his <i>fare</i>.</p>

<p>Potior, to gain, is joined either to a genitive or to an ablative
case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

<p>At least he said he did, when he took the prisoner who would n’t let

<h5>The Dative Case after the Verb.</h5>

<p>All verbs govern a dative case of that thing to or for which any
thing is gotten or taken away, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Diminuam tibi caput:</p>

<p>I will break your head.</p>

</div>

<span class = "pagenum">101</span>
<p>What a thing it is to be a junior boy!</p>

<p>Verbs of various kinds belong to the above rule. In the first place
verbs signifying advantage or disadvantage govern a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Judæi ad commodandum nobis vivunt:</p>

<p>The Jews live to accommodate us.</p>
</div>

<p>Or accommodate us to live&mdash;which?</p>

<p>Of these juvo, lædo<ins class = "correction" title = ", missing">,

<span class = "pagenum">102</span>
<p>Verbs of comparing govern a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ajacem “Surdo” componere sæpe solebam:</p>

<p>I was often accustomed to compare Ajax to the “Deaf un,”&mdash;not
because he was hard of hearing, but hard in hitting.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, however, they require an ablative case with the
preposition cum; sometimes an accusative case with the prepositions ad
and inter, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Comparo <i>Pompeium</i> cum <i>globo nivali</i>:</p>

<p>I compare <i>Pompey</i> with a <i>snow-ball</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Pompey is called in the schools a proper name. Whether it is a
<i>proper name</i> for a nigger or not, may be questioned. It may also
be doubted whether a negro can ever rightly be called “snow-ball,”
except he be <i>an ice</i> man; in which case even though he should be
the knave of <i>clubs</i>, it is obvious that he ought never to be
<i>black balled</i>.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Si ad pensum verberatio comparetur nihil est:</p>

<p>If a flogging be compared to an imposition, it is nothing.</p>
</div>

<p>A flogging is a fly-blow, or at least a <i>flea</i>-blow to the boy,
and a task only to the master; whereas <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘as’">an</ins> imposition is a task to the boy, and very
often a <i>verse</i> task.</p>

<p>Verbs of giving and of restoring govern a dative case, as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">103</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p>Learius unicuique filiarum dimidium coronæ dedit:</p>

<p>Lear gave his daughters half-a-crown a-piece.</p>
</div>

<p>Hence we are enabled to gain some notion of the great value of money
in the time of the Ancient Britons.</p>

<p>Verbs of promising and of paying govern a dative case; as</p>

<p>Hence young men may learn how desirable it is to be “in statu
pupillari.” True, in that state of
<span class = "pagenum">104</span>
felicity, they are somewhat under control, but the above example, and
many others of a like nature, sufficiently prove, that such restriction,
compared to the responsibilities of manhood, is but a <i>minor</i>
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Verbs of commanding and telling govern a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Alexander, vinosus, animis imperare non potuit:</p>

<p>Alexander, when drunk, could not command his temper.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus, in a state of beer, he committed manslaughter at least, by
killing and slaying his friend Clitus. We could not resist the
temptation to mention this fact, since, as we have so often laughed at
its narration in those interesting compositions called themes, we
thought there must needs be something very funny about it. Alexander the
Great, be it remarked, for the special behoof of schoolboys, furnishes
an example of any virtue or vice descanted on in any prose task or poem
under the sun.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Antonio dixit Augustus Lepidum veteratorem fuisse.</p>

<p>Augustus told Antony that Lepidus was a humbug.</p>

<i>Lepidus</i> is a <i>funny</i> name.</p>

<p>Except, from the foregoing rule, rego, to rule,
<span class = "pagenum">105</span>
guberno, to govern, which have an accusative case; tempero and moderor,
to rule, which have sometimes a dative, sometimes an accusative case;
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘others’">other’s</ins> charms
and accomplishments.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Intempestive parum longe prospicienti Doctori adlusit.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">109</span>
<p>He joked unseasonably on the short-sighted Doctor.</p>
</div>

<p>Johnson was not so short-sighted as to be blind to a joke.</p>

<p>Not a few of the verbs mentioned in the last rule, sometimes change
the dative into another case; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Præstat ingenio alius alium:</p>

<p>One exceeds another in ability.</p>
</div>

<p class = "illustration">

<p>Thus one boy learns Latin and Greek better than the rest; another
learns slang. One is a good hand at construing, another at climbing.
Some boys are peculiarly skilled at casting accounts, others in casting
stones. Here we have a boy of a small appetite and many words, there one
of a large appetite and few words. Sometimes precocious talent is
evinced for playing the fiddle, sometimes
<span class = "pagenum">110</span>
for playing a <i>stick</i>; sometimes, again, a&nbsp;strong propensity
is discovered for playing the fool. This boy makes verses, as it were,
by inspiration; that boy shows an equal capacity in making mouths. The
most peculiar talent, however, and the one most exclusive of all others,
is that of riding. Those who are destined to attain great proficiency in
this science, can seldom do any thing else; and usually begin their
career by being <i>horsed</i> at school.</p>

<p>Est, for habeo to have, governs a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Est mihi qui vestes custodit avunculus omnes:</p>

<p>I have an uncle who takes care of all my clothes.</p>
</div>

<p>Suppetit, it sufficeth, is like to this, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Pauper enim non est cui rerum suppetit usus:</p>

<p>For he is not poor, to whom the use of things suffices.</p>
</div>

<p>The two last examples must suggest a rather alarming idea to those
who are accustomed to propitiate the relation to whom we have just
alluded, by relinquishing <i>their habits</i>. Is it possible that he
can ever <i>use</i> one’s <i>things</i>? We recommend this query to the
serious consideration of theatrical persons, and all others who are
addicted to <i>spouting</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sum</i> with many <i>others</i> admits a double dative case,
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Exitio est avidis alvus pueris:</p>

<p>The belly is the destruction of greedy boys.</p>
</div>

<p>Particularly those of <i>Eton</i> College.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">111</span>
<p>Sometimes this dative case tibi, or sibi, or also mihi, is added for
the sake of elegance in expression, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Cato suam sibi uxorem Hortensio vendidit:</p>

<p>Cato sold his own wife to Hortensius.</p>
</div>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic111.png" width = "316" height = "328"
alt = "(scene as described above)"></p>

<p>Some say he only lent her. The fact most probably is, that the lady,
being tired of her husband, wished to be a-<i>loan</i>.</p>


<span class = "pagenum">112</span>
<h5>The Accusative Case after the Verb.</h5>

<p>Verbs transitive, of what kind soever, whether active, deponent, or
common, require an accusative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Procuratorem fugito, nam subdolus idem est:</p>

<p>Avoid an attorney, for the same is a cunning rogue.</p>
</div>

<p>Yet the legal profession are always boasting of their
<i>deeds</i>.</p>

<p>Verbs neuter have an accusative case of a like signification to
themselves, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Pomarii asinus duram servit servitutem:</p>

<p>A coster-monger’s donkey serves a hard servitude.</p>
</div>

<p>Poor animal! A <i>Sterne</i> heart was once melted by thy
sufferings&mdash;how then must they affect that of the <i>gentle</i>
reader?</p>

<p>There are some verbs which have an accusative case by a figure,
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Nec vox hominem sonat;</p>

<p>Nor does your voice sound like a human creature’s.</p>
</div>

<p>This may be said of boys of various kinds&mdash;as pot-boys,
butcher’s boys, baker’s boys, and other boys who are in the habit of
bawling down areas; also of several descriptions of men, as cab-men,
coach-men, watch-men, and dust-men. The same may likewise be asserted of
some women, such
<span class = "pagenum">113</span>
as apple-women, oyster-women, fish-women, and match-women. Here also the
singing of charity children of both sexes, and the voices of
parish-clerks, may be specified, and, lastly, of many foreigners whose
names terminate in ini.</p>

<p class = "illustration">
<img src = "images/pic113.png" width = "306" height = "79"
alt = "women with open mouths"></p>

<p>Verbs of asking, of teaching, of clothing, and of concealing,
commonly govern two accusative cases, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ego docebo te, adolescentule, lectiones tuas:</p>

<p><i>I’ll</i> teach you your lessons, young man.</p>
</div>

<p>This speech is usually the prelude to something which elicits that
exemplification of the vocative case which has been given in the first
part of the Grammar.</p>

<p>Some verbs of this kind have an accusative case even in the passive
voice, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Bis denos posceris versus de scoparum manubrio:</p>

<p>You are required to make twenty verses on a broomstick.</p>
</div>

<p>Why should not a broomstick form the subject of a poetical effusion,
when the material of the broom itself is so often used in schools to
stimulate inventive genius?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">114</span>
<p>Nouns appellative are commonly added with a preposition to verbs
which denote motion, as</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Interea ad templum non æquæ Palladis ibant</p>
<p>Crinibus Iliades passis. &nbsp; <i>Virgil.</i></p>
</div>

<p class = "grammar">
In the mean time the Trojan woman went to the temple of unfriendly
Pallas with their hair about their ears.</p>

<p>How odd they must have looked. Here we take occasion to remind
schoolboys never to lose an opportunity of giving a comic rendering to
any word or phrase susceptible thereof, which they may meet with in the
course of their reading. To say “crinibus passis”,&mdash;“with
dishevelled hair” would be to give a very feeble and spiritless
translation. Vir is literally construed <i>man</i>; some school-masters
will have it called <i>hero</i>,&mdash;we propose to translate it
<i>cove</i>. So dapes may be rendered <i>grub</i>, or perhaps
<i>prog</i>; aspera Juno, <i>crusty Juno</i>; animam efflare, to <i>kick
the bucket</i>; capere fugam, to <i>cut one’s stick</i>, or
<i>lucky</i>; confectus, <i>knocked up</i>; fraudatus, <i>choused</i>;
contundere, <i>to whop</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>


<h5>The Ablative Case after the Verb.</h5>

<p>Every verb admits an ablative case, signifying the instrument, or the
cause, or the manner of an action, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Pulvere nitrato Catilina senatum subruere voluit:</p>

<p>Catiline wished to blow up the Parliament. Catiline was a regular
Guy.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">115</span>
<p>A noun of price is put after some words in the ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ovidius solidis duobus fibulas siphonem ascendere fecit:</p>

<p>Ovid pawned his buckles for two shillings.</p>
</div>

<p>The <i>sipho</i> was a tube, pipe, or spout, projecting from the
shops of pawnbrokers, of whom there is every reason to believe that
there were a great many in ancient Rome. Into this <i>sipho</i> the
pledges <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘where’">were</ins> placed in order to be conveyed to the <i>adytum</i>
or secret recess of the dwelling. <i>Vide</i> Casaubon de Avunc:
Roman.</p>

<p>Vili, at a low rate, paulo, for little, minimo, for very little,
magno, for much, nimio, for too much, plurimo, for very much, dimidio,
for half, duplo, for twice as much, are often put by themselves, the
word, pretio, price, being understood, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Vili venit cibus caninus:</p>

<p>Dog’s meat is sold at a low rate.</p>
</div>

<p>These genitive cases put without substantives are excepted, tanti,
for so much, quanti, for how much, pluris, for more, minoris, for less,
quantivis, for as much as you please, tantidem, for just so much,
quantilibet, for what you will, quanticunque for how much soever, as</p>

<p class = "grammar">
Non es tanti: You’re no great shakes.</p>

<p>Flocci, of a lock of wool, nauci, of a nut-shell, nihili, of nothing,
assis, of a penny, pili, of a hair,
<span class = "pagenum">116</span>
hujus, of this, teruncii, of a farthing, are added very properly to
verbs of esteeming, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Nec verberationem flocci pendo, nec ferulâ percussionem pili
æstimo:</p>

<p>I don’t value a flogging a straw, nor do I regard a spatting a
hair.</p>
</div>

<p>A boy who can say this, must have a brazen front, and an iron back,
and be altogether a lad of <i>mettle</i>.</p>

<p>Verbs of abounding, of filling, of loading, and their contraries, are
joined to an ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Tauris abundat Hibernia:</p>

<p>Ireland aboundeth in bulls.</p>
</div>

<p>This circumstance it most probably was which gave rise to the
<i>Tales</i> of the O’Hara family.</p>

<p>We once heard a son of Erin, while undergoing the operation of
bleeding from the arm, remark that that would be an easy way of
<i>cutting one’s throat</i>.</p>

<p>Some of these sometimes govern a genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Optime ostrearum implebantur:</p>

<p>They had a capital blow out of oysters.</p>
</div>

<p>We are sorry to remark that these are the only <i>native</i>
productions patronized by great people.</p>

<p>Fungor, to discharge, fruor, to enjoy, utor, to use, vescor, to live
upon, dignor, to think one’s self
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
worthy, muto, to change, communico, to communicate, supersedeo, to pass
by, are joined to an ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Qui adipisci cœnas optimas volet, leonis fungatur officiis.</p>

<p>He who shall desire to obtain excellent dinners, should discharge the
office of a lion.</p>
</div>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/pic117.png" width = "107" height = "302"
alt = "man standing on pedestal of books"></p>

<p>In which case he will come in for the “lion’s share.”</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Why is the lion of a party like one of the grand sources of
prejudice mentioned by Lord Bacon?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Because he is the <i>Idol</i> of the <i>den</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<p>Mereor, to deserve, with these adverbs, bene, well, satis, enough,
male, ill, melius, better, pejus, worse, optime, very well, pessime,
very ill, is joined to an ablative case with the preposition de, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>De libitinario medicus bene meretur:</p>

<p>The doctor deserves well of the undertaker.</p>
</div>

<p>Notwithstanding it might at first sight appear, that the doctor, in
<i>furnishing funerals</i>, invades the undertaker’s province.</p>

<p>Some verbs of receiving, of being distant, and of taking away, are
sometimes joined to a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Augustus eripuit mihi nitorem:</p>

<p>Augustus has taken the shine out of me.</p>

<p class = "center">
<i>Last Dying Speech of M. Antony.</i></p>
</div>

<p>An ablative case, taken absolutely, is added to some verbs, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Porcis volentibus lætissime epulabimur:</p>

<p>Please the pigs we’ll have a jolly good dinner.</p>
</div>

<p>The pig had divine honours paid to it by the ancient Greeks.
&mdash;Jos. Scalig. de Myst. Eleusin.</p>

<p>An ablative case of the part affected, and by the poets an accusative
case, is added to some verbs, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Qui animo ægrotat, eum aera risum moventem ducere oportet.</p>

<p>He who is sick in mind should breathe the laughing gas.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">119</span>
<p>Much learned controversy has been expended in endeavouring to
determine whether this gas was the exhalation by which it is supposed
that the ancient Pythonesses were affected.</p>

<table class = "grammar" summary = "table of inflections">
<tr>
<td>Rubet nasum:<br>
His nose is red.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Candet genas:<br>
His cheeks are pale.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Some of these words are used also with the genitive case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Angitur animi juvenis iste, et mundum indignatur.</p>

<p>That young man is grieved in mind and disgusted with the world.</p>
</div>

<p>Such a man is called by the ladies an interesting young man.</p>


<h5>Verbs Passive.</h5>

<p>An ablative case of the doer (but with the preposition a or ab going
before), and sometimes also a dative case, is added to verbs passive,
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Darius eleganter ab Alexandro victus est:</p>

<p>Darius was elegantly licked by Alexander.</p>
</div>

<p>The other cases continue to belong to verbs passive which belonged to
them as verbs active, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Titanes læsæ majestatis accusati sunt:</p>

<p>The Titans were indicted for high treason.</p>
</div>

<p>And being found guilty were <i>quartered</i> in a very uncomfortable
manner, as well as <i>drawn</i> by various
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
artists, whose skill in <i>execution</i> has been much commended.</p>

<p>Vapulo, to be beaten, veneo, to be sold, liceo, to be prized, exulo,
to be banished, fio, to be made, neuter passives, have a passive
construction, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>A præceptore vapulabis. &nbsp; <i>Eton Gram.</i></p>

<p>You will be beaten by the master.</p>
</div>

<p>It appears to us that vapulo, to be beaten, is here at all events
more susceptible of a passive construction than a funny one.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Malo a cive spoliari quam ab hoste <ins class = "notation" title =
"‘vēnire’ with long ‘e’">venire</ins>. &nbsp; <i>Eton Gram.</i></p>

<p>I had rather be stripped by a citizen than sold by an enemy.</p>
</div>

<p>The Romans were regularly <i>sold</i> by the enemy for once, when
they had to go under the yoke.</p>


<h5>Verbs of the Infinitive Mood.</h5>

<p>Verbs of the infinitive mood are put after some verbs, participles,
and adjectives, and substantives also by the poets, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Timotheus ursos saltare fecit:</p>

<p>Timotheus made the bears dance.</p>
</div>

<p>This was done in ancient as it is in modern times, by playing the
Pandean pipes.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Inconcinnus erat cerni Telamonius Ajax;</p>
<p>Ajax (ut referunt) vir bonus ire minor:</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">121</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p>The Telamonian Ajax was a rum un to look at;</p>
<p>The lesser Ajax (as they say) a good un to go.</p>
</div>

<p>The Grecians used to call Ajax senior, the <i>fighting cock</i>, and
Ajax junior, the <i>running cock</i>.</p>

<p>Verbs of the infinitive mood are sometimes placed alone by the figure
ellipsis, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Siphonum de more oculis demittere fluctus Dardanidæ:</p>

<p>The Trojans (began understood) to pipe their eyes.</p>
</div>

<p>As for Æneas he might have been a town <i>crier</i>.</p>


<h5>Gerunds and Supines</h5>

<p>govern the cases of their own verbs, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Efferor studio pulices industrios videndi:</p>

<p>I am transported with the desire of seeing the industrious fleas.</p>

<h5>Gerunds.</h5>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“When Dido found Æneas would not come,</p>
<p>She mourned in silence, and was Di-do-dum.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gerunds in di have the same construction as genitive cases, and
depend both on certain substantives and adjectives, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Londinensem innatus amor civem urget edendi:</p>

<p>An innate love of eating excites the London citizen.</p>
</div>

<p>People are accustomed to utter a great deal of cant about the
intellectual poverty of civic magistrates, and common councilmen in
general; but it must be allowed that those respectable individuals have
often <i>a great deal in them</i>.</p>

<p>Gerunds in do have the same construction with ablative, and gerunds
in dum with accusative cases, as</p>

<p>A piece of advice of special importance to schoolboys on many
occasions, such as the following: shirking down town; making devils, or
letting off gunpowder behind the school, or in the yard; conducting a
foray or predatory excursion in gardens and orchards; emulating Jupiter,
à&nbsp;la Salmoneus,&mdash;in his attribute of Cloud-Compelling&mdash;by
blowing a cloud, or to speak in the vernacular, indulging in a cigar;
hoisting a frog; tailing a dog or cat, or in any other way acting
contrary to the precepts of the Animals’ Friend Society; learning to
construe on the Hamiltonian system; furtively denuding the birch-rods of
their “budding honours.” Cum multis aliis quæ nunc perscribere longum

<p>Gerunds are also changed into nouns adjective, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

<p>It is a bore to make verses.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p>Except venison, onions, and cheese.</p>


<h5>Nouns of time and Place.<br>
Time.</h5>

<p>Tempus&mdash;time. There is a story, mentioned (we quote from memory)
by the learned Joe Miller; of a fellow who seeing “Tempus Fugit”
inscribed upon a clock, took it for the name of the artificer.</p>

<p>Persons who have lived a long <i>time</i> in the world, are generally
accounted <i>sage</i>; and are sometimes considered to have had a good
<i>seasoning</i>.</p>

<p>Nouns which signify a part of time are put more commonly in the
ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit:</p>

<p>No mortal man is wise at all hours.</p>
</div>

<p>The excuse of a philosopher for getting married.</p>

<p>But nouns which signify the duration of time are commonly put in the
accusative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Pugna inter juvenem Curtium et Titum Sabinum tres horas
perduravit.</p>

<p>The fight between young Curtius and Sabine Titus lasted three

<p>It is an error to suppose that Roman mills were only water-mills and
wind-mills. The above mill

combatants much <i>pains</i>.</p>

<p>We say also: in paucis diebus, in a few days: de die, by day, de
nocte, by night,&nbsp;&amp;c.</p>

<p>A jest upon the nouns of <i>Time</i> would, perhaps, be somewhat ill
timed: we hope, however, to have <i>Space</i> for one presently.</p>


<h5>The Space of a Place.</h5>

<p>The space of a place is put in the accusative, and sometimes also in
the ablative, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Cæsar jam mille passus processerat, summâ diligentiâ.</p>

<p>Cæsar had now advanced a mile with the greatest diligence&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>“Cantare et apponere” to sing and apply, is the maxim we would here
inculcate on our youthful readers.</p>

<p>Every verb admits a genitive case of the name of a city or town in
which any thing takes place, so that it be of the first or second
declension, and of the singular number, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Quid Romæ faciam? mentiri nescio:</p>

<p>What shall I do at Rome? I know not how to lie.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">127</span>
<p>What a bare-faced perversion of the truth that cock and bull story is
of Curtius jumping into the hole in the forum. How the Romans managed to
get <i>credit</i> from any body but the tailors is to us a mystery.</p>

<p>These genitive cases, humi, on the ground, domi, at home, militiæ, in
war, belli, in war, follow the construction of proper names, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Parvi sunt foris arma nisi est consilium domi:</p>

<p>Arms are of little worth abroad unless there be wisdom at home.</p>
</div>

<p>Cicero must have said this with a prospective eye to Canada.</p>

<p>But if the name of a city or town shall be of the plural number only,
or of the third declension, it is put in the ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Aiunt centum portas Thebis fuisse:</p>

<p>They say there were an hundred gates at Thebes.</p>
</div>

<p>You needn’t believe it unless you like.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Egregia Tibure facta videnda sunt:</p>

<p>Fine doings are to be seen at Tivoli.</p>
</div>

<p>The name of a place is often put after verbs signifying motion to a
place in the accusative case without a preposition, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Concessi Cantabrigiam ad capiendum ingenii cultum:</p>

<p>I went to Cambridge to become a fast man.</p>
</div>

<p>After this manner we use domus, a house, and
<span class = "pagenum">128</span>
rus, the country, as Rus ire jussus sum, I&nbsp;was rusticated. Domum
missus eram, I&nbsp;was sent home.</p>

<p>Going <i>too fast</i> at Cambridge sometimes necessitates, in two
senses, a&nbsp;dose of country air.</p>

<p>The name of a place is sometimes added to verbs signifying motion
from a place, in the ablative case without a proposition, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Arbitror te Virginiâ veteri venisse:</p>

<p>I reckon you’ve come from old Virginny.</p>
</div>


<h5>Verbs Impersonal.</h5>

<p>Verbs impersonal have no nominative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Scenas post tragicas multum juvat ire sub umbras:</p>

<p>After a tragedy it is very pleasant to go under the
<i>Shades</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The worst of these “Shades” is, that people are now and then apt to
get rather “too much in the sun” there.</p>

<p>These impersonals, interest, it concerns, and refert, it concerns,
are joined to any genitive cases, except these ablative cases feminine,
meâ, tuâ, suâ, nostrâ, vestrâ, and cujâ, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Interest magistratûs tueri insulsos, animadvertere in acres.</p>

<p>It concerns the magistrate to defend the flats; to punish the
sharps.</p>
</div>

<p>These genitive cases also, are added, tanti, of so much, quanti, of
how much, magni, of much,
<span class = "pagenum">129</span>
parvi, of little, quanticunque, of how much soever, tantidem, of just so
much; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Tanti refert honesta agere;</p>

<p>Of such consequence is it to do honest things.</p>
</div>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/pic129.png" width = "81" height = "106"
alt = "judge in wig"></p>

<p>By this course of conduct, you certainly render yourself worthy of
the protection of the magistrate; although whether you thereby
constitute yourself a flat or not, is perhaps a doubtful question. Much
may be said on both sides. Dishonesty, it is true, may lead to being
taken up; but then honesty often leads to being taken <i>in</i>. Yet
honesty is said to be the best policy. Policy is a branch of wisdom, and
“wisdom” they say “is in the <i>wig</i><ins class = "correction" title =
"close quote missing">.”</ins> Certain <i>wigs</i> are retained at the
<i>head</i>&mdash;of affairs, by a good deal of <i>policy</i>; perhaps
the <i>best</i> they could adopt&mdash;a&nbsp;fact that throws
considerable doubt on the truth of the old maxim.</p>

<p>Impersonal verbs which are put acquisitively, require a dative case;
but those which are put transitively an accusative, as&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">130</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p>A ministris nobis benefit:</p>

<p>We enjoy blessings from Ministers.</p>
</div>

<p>For instance&mdash;No&mdash;We cannot think of any just at
present.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Me juvat per lunam errare, et “Isabellam” cantare:</p>

<p>I like to wander by moonlight, and sing “Isabelle.”</p>
</div>

<p>The connexion between love and moonlight is as interesting as it is
certain. We shrewdly suspect that the said planet has more to do with
the tender passion than lovers are aware of.</p>

<p>But the preposition <i>ad</i> is peculiarly <i>ad</i>ded to these
verbs&mdash;attinet, it belongs, pertinet, it pertains, spectat, it
concerns, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Spectat ad omnes bene vivere:</p>

<p>It concerns all to live well&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>When they can afford it.</p>

<p>An accusative case with a genitive is put after these verbs
impersonal&mdash;pœnitet, it repents, tædet, it wearies, miseret,
miserescit, it pities, pudet, it shames, piget, it grieves,
as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>“Nihil me pœnitet hujus nasi”&mdash;Trist: Shand:</p>

<p>“My nose has been the making of me.”</p>
</div>

<p>A verb impersonal of the passive voice may be elegantly taken for
each person of both numbers; that is to say, by virtue of a case added
to it.</p>

<p>Thus statur is used for sto, stas, stat, stamus,
<span class = "pagenum">131</span>
statis, stant. Statur a me; it is stood by me, that is, I stand; statur
ab illis: it is stood by them, or they stand.</p>

<h5>The Construction of Participles.</h5>

<p>Participles govern the cases of the verbs from which they are
derived, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "indent2">&emsp;Duplices tendens ad sidera palmas,</p>
<p>Talia voce refert:</p>
</div>

<p class = "grammar">

<p>This reminds us of the Italian opera.</p>

<p>A dative case is sometimes added to participles of the passive voice,
especially when they end in dus, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Sollicito nasus rutilans metuendus amanti est:</p>

<p>A fiery nose is to be feared by an anxious lover.</p>
</div>

<p>Participles, when they become nouns, require a genitive case,
as&mdash;</p>

<span class = "pagenum">133</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p>Vectigalis appetens, linguæ profusus:</p>

<p>Greedy of <i>rint</i>, lavish of blarney.</p>
</div>

<p>Exosus, hating, perosus, utterly hating, pertæsus, weary of,
signifying actively, require an accusative case, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Philosophus exosus ad unam mulieres:</p>

<p>A philosopher hating women in general, <i>i.e.</i> a Malthusian.</p>
</div>

<p>Exosus, hated, and perosus, hated to death, signifying passively, are
read with a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Comœdi sanctis exosi sunt:</p>

<p>The comedians are hated by the saints.</p>
</div>

<p>We mean the spiritual Quixotes, or Knights of the Rueful Countenance.
We “calculate” that they will be the greatest patrons of rail roads,
considering their dislike to the <i>stage</i>.</p>

<p>Natus, born, prognatus, born, satus, sprung, cretus, descended,
creatus, produced, ortus, risen, editus, brought forth, require an
ablative case, and often with a preposition, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Taffius, bonis prognatus parentibus, cerevisiam haud tenuem de sese
existimat:</p>

<p>Taffy, sprung of good parents, thinks no small beer of himself.</p>

<h5>The Construction of Adverbs.</h5>

<p>En and ecce, adverbs of showing, are joined most commonly to a
nominative case, to an accusative case but seldom, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>En Romanus: See the Roman (q. rum-un.)</p>

<p>Ecce Corinthium: Behold the Corinthian.</p>
</div>

<p>Modern Corinthians, we fear, know but little Greek, except that of
the Ægidiac, or St. Giles’s dialect.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/pic134.png" width = "277" height = "198"
alt = "boys laughing at well-dressed boy"></p>

<p>En and ecce, adverbs of upbraiding, are joined most commonly to an
accusative case only, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>En togam squamosam!</p>

<p>Look at his scaly toga!</p>

<p>Ecce caudam! &nbsp; Twig his tail!</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">135</span>
<p>Certain adverbs of time, place, and quantity, admit a genitive case,
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ubi gentium est Quadra Russelliana?</p>

<p>Where in the world is Russell Square?</p>
</div>

<p>We must confess that this question is <i>exquisitely</i> absurd.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Nihil tunc temporis amplius quam flere poteram:</p>

<p>I could do nothing more at that time than weep.</p>

</div>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Satis eloquentiæ, sapientiæ parum:</p>

<p>Eloquence enough, wisdom little enough.</p>
</div>

<p>This quotation applies very forcibly to domestic oratory as practised
by small boys at the instigation of their mamma, for the
<i>amusement</i> of visitors. Those on whom “little bird with boothom
wed,” <ins class = "correction" title = "open quote missing">“</ins>deep
<i>in</i> the windingths <i>of</i> a whale,” or “my name is Nawval,” and
the like recitations are inflicted, have “satis eloquentiæ”&mdash;enough
of eloquence, in all conscience; and we cannot but think that “sapientiæ
parum,” “wisdom little enough” is displayed by all the other parties
concerned.</p>

<p>Some adverbs admit the cases of the nouns from which they are
derived, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">

</div>

<span class = "pagenum">136</span>
<p>Especially if he have a large circle of female acquaintance.</p>

<p>These adverbs of diversity, aliter, otherwise, and secus, otherwise;
and these two, ante, before, and post, after, are often joined to an
ablative case, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Plure aliter. &nbsp; More t’other.</p>

<p>Multo ante. &nbsp; Much before.</p>

make it up by a <i>bustle</i>.</p>

<p>Instar, like or equal to, and ergo, for the sake of, being taken as
adverbs, have a genitive case after them, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Instar montis equum divina <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Paladis’">Palladis</ins> arte</p>

<p>Virgil tells lies for fun.</p>
</div>

<p>As may be sufficiently seen in the example before the last, and also

<h5>The Construction of Conjunctions.</h5>

<p>Conjunctions copulative and disjunctive, couple like cases, moods,
and tenses, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Socrates docuit Xenophontem et Platonem geographiam, astronomiam, et
rationem globorum:</p>

<p>Socrates taught Xenophon and Plato geography, astronomy, and the use

</div>

<p><i>Q.</i> How may a waterman answer the polite interrogation “Who are
you?” correctly, and designate at the same time, an educational
institution.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> By saying A-cad-am-I.</p>

<p>The foregoing rule (not riddle) holds good, unless the reason of a
different construction requires it should be otherwise, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Emi librum centussi et pluris:</p>

<p>I bought a book for a hundred pence, and more,</p>

<p class = "center">
“100<i>d.</i> are 8<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>” &mdash;Walkinghame.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<p>The conjunction, quam, than, is often understood after amplius, more,
plus, more, and minus, less, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Amplius sunt sex menses:</p>

<p>There are more than six months.</p>
</div>

<p>For this interesting piece of information we are indebted to Cicero.
The author to whom reference has just been made, has somewhere, if we
mistake not, a&nbsp;similar observation. In thus <i>ushering</i> the
<i>Tutor’s</i> Assistant into notice, we feel that we are citing a work
of which it is impossible to make too comical mention.</p>

<p>Thank goodness there are not more than six months in a half year!</p>


<h5>To what Moods of Verbs certain Adverbs<br>
and Conjunctions do agree.</h5>

<p>Ne, an, num, whether put doubtfully or indefinitely, are joined to a
subjunctive mood, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Nihil refert fecerisne an persuaseris:</p>

<p>It matters nothing whether you have done it or persuaded to
it&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>as the school-master said when he got hold of the wrong end of the
cane.</p>

<p>Here it may be remarked&mdash;First, that the young gentlemen who
play tricks with <i>tallow</i> are likely to get more <i>whacks</i> than
they like on their fingers. Secondly&mdash;That a master whose hand is
in <i>Grease</i> cannot be expected to be at the same time in
<i>A-merry-key</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<p>Dum, for dummodo, so that, and quousque, until, requires a
subjunctive mood, as&mdash;</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Dum felix sis, quid refert?</p>

<p>What’s the odds, so long as you’re happy.</p>
</div>

<p>Qui, signifying the cause, requires a subjunctive mood, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Stultus es qui Ovidio credas:</p>

<p>You are a fool for believing Ovid.</p>
</div>

<p>Ut, for, postquam<ins class = "correction" title = ", missing">,
</ins>after that, sicut, as, and quomodo, how, is joined to an
indicative mood; but when it signifies quanquam, although<ins class =
"correction" title = ", missing">, </ins>utpote, forasmuch as, or the
final cause, to a subjunctive mood, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ut sumus in Ponto ter frigore constitit Ister:</p>

<p>Since that we are in Pontus the Danube has stood frozen three
times.</p>
</div>

<p>Were skating and sliding classical accomplishments? Ambition, we
know, led many of the Romans to tread on <i>slippery</i> ground: many of
them struck out new paths, but none (that we have heard of) ever struck
out a slide. Imagine Cato or Seneca “coming the cobbler’s knock.”</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Te oro, domine, ut exeam:</p>

<p>Please, sir, let me go out.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, all words put indefinitely, such as are these, quis, who,
quantus, how great, quotus, how many, require a subjunctive mood, as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">140</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p>Cave cui incurras, inepte:</p>

<p>Mind who you run against, stupid.</p>

<h5>The construction of Prepositions.</h5>

<p>A preposition being understood, sometimes causes an ablative case to
be added, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Habeo pigneratorem loco avunculi; <i>i.e.</i> in loco:</p>

<p>I esteem a pawnbroker in the place of an uncle: that is, <i>in
loco</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>A preposition in composition sometimes governs the same case which it
also governed out of composition, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Jupiter Olympo Vulcanum calce exegit:</p>

<p>Jupiter kicked Vulcan out of Olympus.</p>
</div>

<p>This was not only an ungentlemanly, but also an <i>ungodly</i> act on
Jupiter’s part. Reasoning à posteriori, one would think it must have
been very unpleasant to Vulcan.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Præteriit me in Quadrante insalutatum:</p>

<p>He cut me in the Quadrant.</p>
</div>

<p>Verbs compounded with a, ab, de, e, ex, in, sometimes repeat the same
prepositions with their case out of composition, and that elegantly,
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Abstinuerunt a vino:</p>

<p>They abstained from wine.</p>
</div>

<p>This properly is an allusion to the Tiber-totallers. It should be
remembered that tea was unknown in Rome, except as the accusative case
of a pronoun.</p>

<p>In, for, erga, towards, contra, against, ad, to, and supra, above,
requires an accusative case, as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">142</span>
<div class = "verse">
<p class = "center">
Quietum</p>
<p>Accipit in pueros animum mentemque benignam:</p>
</div>

<p class = "grammar">
He admits kind thoughts and inclinations towards the boys.</p>

<p>The master does&mdash;when he gives them a half holiday or a blow
out. Mr. Squeers (vide Nicholas Nick: illustriss. Boz.) was in the habit
of <i>making much</i> of the young gentlemen intrusted to his care.</p>

<p>Sub, when it relates to time, is commonly joined to an accusative
case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Sub idem tempus&mdash;Isaaculus trans maria deportatus est<ins class

<p>About the same time&mdash;Ikey was transported beyond the seas.</p>
</div>

<p>We say <i>beyond the seas</i>, lest it should be questioned whether
Mr.&nbsp;I. was <i>transported</i> as a necessary or contingent
consequence of cheating.</p>

<p>Super, for, ultra, beyond, is put with an accusative case, for de,
concerning, with an ablative case, as</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "center">
Super et Garamantas et Indos</p>
<p>Proferet imperium:</p>

<span class = "pagenum">143</span>
<p>Tenus, as far as, is joined to an ablative case, both in the singular
and plural number, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Cervice, auribusque tenus Marius in luto inveniebatur:</p>

<p>Marius was found up to his neck and ears in mud.</p>
</div>

<p>What a lark! or rather a mud lark. But tenus is joined to a genitive
only in the plural, and it always follows its case, as</p>

<p class = "grammar">
Crurum tenus: &nbsp; up to the <i>legs</i>.</p>

<p>Which it is very necessary to be at Epsom and Ascot.</p>


<h5>The Construction of Interjections.</h5>

<p>Interjections are often put without a case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Spem gregis, ah! silice in nudâ connixa reliquit:</p>

<p>Having <ins class = "notation" title = "archaic word">yeaned</ins>,

</div>

<p>And exposed to the <i>steely</i>-hearted world, which, as an Irishman
remarked, was a dangerous situation for <i>tinder</i> infancy. It must
have been, to say the least, a&nbsp;most uncomfortable <i>berth</i>.</p>

<p>O! of one exclaiming, is joined to a nominative, accusative, and
vocative case, as</p>

<p class = "grammar">
O lex! Oh law! &nbsp; O alaudas<ins class = "correction" title = "text has ,">! </ins>Oh larks! &nbsp; Oh meum! Oh my! &nbsp; O&nbsp;care! Oh

<p>We cannot find out what is Latin for oh Crikey!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">141</span>
<p>Heu! and proh! alas! are joined, sometimes to a nominative, sometimes
to an accusative, and occasionally to a vocative case, as&mdash;Heu
bellis! Lack-a-<i>daisy</i>. Heu diem! Lack-a-<i>day</i>. Proh Clamor!
Oh <i>cry</i>! Proh deos pisciculosque! Oh, ye gods and little
fishes!</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Heu miserande puer!</p>

<p>Oh, boy, to be pitied!</p>
</div>

<p>What boy is more to be pitied than a junior boy? The <i>Fagin</i>
system described in Oliver Twist is nothing compared to that adopted in
public schools. People may say what they will of the beneficial effect
which it produces on the minds of those who are subjected to it&mdash;we
contend that to breed a gentleman’s son up like a <i>tiger</i> is the
readiest way to make a <i>beast</i> of him.</p>

<p>Hei! and væ! alas, are joined to a dative case, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Hei mihi quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis:</p>

<p>Ovid never would have said that, if he had smoked a cigar or chewed

<p>This would be a proper place for introducing a few remarks on the
ancient mode of serenading; which we are prevented from doing by the
very imperfect state of our present information on this interesting
point. It is, however, pretty generally admitted that the Romans always
took care to provide themselves with an umbrella on these occasions, and
this for a reason which the above distich will have rendered
sufficiently obvious. It appears to us that so salutary a precaution is
well worthy of being sometimes adopted in these modern days&mdash;and
with this hint we conclude the Syntax.</p>

<hr class = "micro">

<h4><a name = "prosody" id = "prosody">PROSODY.</a></h4>

<div class = "verse">
<p>All you that bards of note would be,</p>
<p>Must study well your Prosody.</p>
</div>

<p>As Comparative Anatomy teaches what the sound of a cod-fish is; so
Prosody teaches what is the sound of syllables.</p>

<p>Sound and quantity mean the same thing; though how that fact is to be
reconciled with the proverb, “great <i>cry</i> and little <i>wool</i>,”
we do not know.</p>

<p>Prosody is divided into three parts. Tone, Breathing, and Time. As to
tone&mdash;boys are usually required to repeat it in a loud one, without
stammering or drawling; and with as little breathing and time, or
breathing-time, as possible.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">147</span>
<p>We shall leave tone to the consideration of pianoforte and
fiddle-makers; and breathing to doctors and chemists, who can
<i>analyze</i> it a great deal better than we can. In this place we
think proper to treat only of Time.</p>

<p>Now of Time a very great deal may be said, taking the word in all the
senses in which it is capable of being used.</p>

<p>In the first place, Time flies&mdash;but this we have had occasion to
observe before; as also that Time is a very great eater.</p>

<p>In the second, Time is a very ill-used personage; he is spent,
wasted, lost, kicked down, and killed&mdash;the last as often as an
Irishman is&mdash;but for all that he never complains.</p>

<p>It is a question whether keeping Time, or losing Time, is the
essential characteristic of dancing.</p>

<p>Then we might expatiate largely about the value of Time, and of the
propriety of taking him by the forelock&mdash;but for two reasons.</p>

<p>One of them is, that all this has been said long ago; the other, that
it is nothing at all to the purpose.</p>

<p>We might also quote extensively from Dr. Culpeper’s Herbal, and from
Linnæus and Jussieu; but the <i>time</i> we speak of, (although we hope
it will be <i>twigged</i> by the reader,) is no <i>plant</i>;
nevertheless it is a necessary ingredient in grammatical
<i>stuffing</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">148</span>
<p>Time in prosody is the measure of the pronouncing of a syllable.</p>

<p>Like whist, it is divided into Long and Short. A long time is marked
thus, as sūmēns, taking: a&nbsp;short time thus; as pĭlŭlă,
a&nbsp;pill.</p>

<p>A foot is the placing together of two or more syllables, according to
the certain observation of their <i>time</i>, the organ of which should
be well developed for that purpose.</p>

<p>Ordinary feet are long feet, short feet, broad feet, splay feet, club
feet, and bumble feet, to which may be added cloven feet in the case of
certain animals, and an “old gentleman.”</p>

<p>There are several kinds of Latin feet; here, however, we shall only
notice spondees and dactyls.</p>

<p>A spondee is a foot of two syllables, as īnfāns, an infant.</p>

<p>A dactyl is a foot of three syllables, as āngĕlŭs, an angel,
pōrcŭlŭs, a&nbsp;little pig.</p>

<p>Scanning is measuring a verse as you are measured by your
tailor&mdash;by the <i>foot</i>, according to <i>rule</i>. To scanning
there belong the figures called Synalœpha, Ecthlipsis<ins class =
"correction" title = ", missing">, </ins>Synæresis, Diæresis, and
Cæsura.</p>

<p>Synalœpha is the cutting off a vowel at the end of a word, before
another at the beginning of the next; as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">149</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ōcclūsīs ēvāsi ŏcŭlīs <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘nāsōqŭe’">nāsōquĕ</ins> cruēntō:</p>

<p>I came off with my eyes bunged up and a bloody nose.</p>
</div>

<p>We have here <i>knocked out an i</i> in evasi, on the strength of a
synalœpha.</p>

<p>But heu and o are never cut off&mdash;at least there are no cases on
record in which this operation has been performed.</p>

<p>Ecthlipsis is as often as the letter m is cut off with its vowel; the
next word beginning with a vowel, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Mōnstrum hōrrēndum īnfōrme īngēns&mdash;spectāvĭmŭs hōrtīs:</p>

<p>We saw a horrible, ugly, great monster in the gardens.</p>
</div>

<p>If every <i>bear</i> and <i>boar</i> were kept in a den&mdash;what a
fine world this would be.</p>

<p>Synæresis is the contraction of two syllables into one, as in
alvearia, pronounced alvaria.</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Strāvĭt hŭmī dēmēns cōnfērta ālveārĭă Jūnō:</p>

<p>Mad Juno threw the crowded beehives on the ground.</p>
</div>

<p>Hydrophobia occurring in a queen bee from the bite of a dog would be
an interesting case to the faculty.</p>

<p>Diæresis is the separation of one syllable into two, as evoluisse for
evolvisse. Thus Ovid says, alluding probably to the <i>padding</i>
system adopted by dandies and theatrical artists<ins class =
"correction" title = "text has .">,&nbsp;</ins></p>

<p>Dēbŭĕrant fūsōs ēvŏlŭīssĕ sŭōs:</p>

<p>They ought to have unwound their <i>spindles</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Cæsura is when after a perfect foot (though not one like Taglioni’s),
a&nbsp;short syllable is made long at the end of a word, as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Pēctŏrĭbūs ĭnhĭāns&mdash;mōllēs, ēn, dēsĕrĭt ālās:</p>

<p>Intent upon the breasts (of the fowls) lo! he deserts the tender

</div>


<h5>Of the Kinds of Verses.</h5>

<p>Should any one seek here for an account of every kind of verse used
by the Latin poets, all we can say is&mdash;we wish he may get it. As it
behoveth no one to be wiser than the law, so it behoveth not us to be
wiser than the Eton Grammar.</p>

<p>The verses which boys are commonly taught to make are hexameters and
pentameters.</p>

<p>An hexameter verse consists of six feet. As the ancient heroes were
at least six feet high, this is probably the reason why it is also
called an <i>heroic</i> verse.</p>

<p>The fifth foot in this kind of verse should be a dactyl, the sixth a
spondee; the other feet may be either dactyls or spondees; as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Ōbstāntī plŭvĭīs vēnīt cūm tēgmĭnĕ Sāmbō:</p>

<p>Sambo came with his Macintosh.</p>
</div>

<p>The fifth foot also is sometimes a spondee, as</p>

<span class = "pagenum">151</span>
<div class = "grammar">
<p><ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Clāvigĕr’ with unmarked ‘i’">Clāvĭgĕr</ins> Ālcīdēs, māgnūm Jŏvĭs īncrēmēntūm.</p>

<p>Hercules, king of clubs, great offspring of Jupiter.</p>
</div>

<p>The last syllable of every verse is a <i>common</i> affair.</p>

<p>An elegiac, lack-a-daisical, or pentameter verse, consists of four
feet and two long syllables, one of which is placed between the second
and third foot, and the other at the end of the verse. The two first
feet may be dactyls, spondees, or both; the two last are always dactyls,
as</p>

<div class = "grammar">
<p>Rēs ēst <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘īnfelīx’">īnfēlīx</ins>, plēnăquĕ frāudĭs ămōr:</p>

<p>Love is an unlucky affair, and full of humbug.</p>
</div>

<p>We feel compelled, notwithstanding what has been before said, to make
a few additions to what is contained in the Eton Grammar with respect to
verses.</p>

<p>The rhythm of Latin verses may be easily learned by practising (out
of school), exercises on the principle of the examples
following&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Dūm dĭdlĕ, dī dūm, dūm dūm, dēedlĕdy, dēēdlĕ dĕ, dūm dum;</p>

<p>N.B. The following familiar piece of poetry would not have been
admitted into the Comic Latin Grammar, but that there being many various
readings of it, we wished to transmit the right one to posterity.</p>

<i>i</i>.</p>

<p class = "figfloat">
<img src = "images/pic153.png" width = "82" height = "165"

<p>Except, likewise, those genitive and dative cases of the fifth

between two <i>i</i>’s, as faciēi, of a face.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">154</span>

<p>Fīent quæ “Fĭeri Facias” mandata vocantur:</p>

<p>The writ which is called “Fieri Facias” will be made.</p>

mattress that a rich one may lounge on his ottoman. Ca. Sa. is a similar
benevolent contrivance for punishing misfortune as felony.</p>

<p>Dīus, heavenly, has the first syllable long;&mdash;Diana, common: and

<div class = "verse">
<p>Thus there’s a common medium of connexion,</p>

<div class = "grammar">

</div>

<div class = "grammar">

are assigned the same quantity as those which they are derived from,
with some
<span class = "pagenum">155</span>

<p>Compounds follow the quantity of their simple words, as from lĕgo
lĕgis, to read, comes perlĕgo, to read through.</p>

for which we consumed our midnight oil; and not only that, but also
burnt a great deal of daylight.&mdash;Our work, we say, is
ended&mdash;and such as it is we commit it to the world. Horace says
Carm. Lib. iii, Ode XXX. (an ode which by some strange association of
ideas, is always connected in our mind with the visionary image of a jug
of ale,) “Exegi
<span class = "pagenum">163</span>
monumentum ære perennius,” I&nbsp;have perfected a work more durable
than brass. Whether our production is characterized by the
<i>durability</i> of that metal or not, is a question which we leave to
the decision of posterity; we cannot, however, help thinking that,
considering the boldness of our attempt, it possesses figuratively at
least, something in common with the substance in question&mdash;and we
would fain hope that that something does not consist in
<i>hardness</i>.</p>

<p>And now farewell to the reader&mdash;farewell, “a&nbsp;word that must
be and hath been”&mdash;said a great many times when once would have
been quite sufficient. We need not, therefore, repeat it; nor need we
say how much we hope that we have amused, instructed him, and so forth;
that being as much an understood thing to put at the end of a book, as
“Love to papa, mamma, brothers and sisters,” in a holiday letter.</p>

<p>Nothing, then, remains for us now to do, but to kick up our hat and
cry</p>

<p>The <i>Eton Grammar</i> began in the first half of the 16th century
as the <i>Brevissima Institutio</i>, later <i>Rudimenta Grammatices</i>,
by William Lily, Lilly or Lilye (d. 1522). A 1758 revision acquired the
name <i>Eton Latin Grammar</i>. The headers <i>Propria quae maribus</i>

<p><b>īngens, great, Ājax, the name of a hero</b> (p. 152)<br>
Both syllables in “Ajax” are long. Here, the “j” is to be pronounced as
a “double letter” (technically an affricate) as in English.</p>

<p><b>alterĭus has always a short <i>i</i> and alīus a long <i>i</i></b>
(p. 153)<br>
The “i” in “alterius” is conventionally shortened in poetry to
